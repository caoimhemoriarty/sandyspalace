Another WhatsApp notification buzzes. It's the family group chat, for the tenth time this morning. I swipe it away as always, but refuse to mute it.<br><br>

I check the password manager daily for logins that still use my deadname. Thirteen. Four relate to work and are therefore stuck for the medium-term. Seven relate to companies that are stubborn, backwards, or just plain broken. Two are last-gasp backups.<br><br>

Ignore the ninty-three victories, and the stray five logins that are stuck on a different name of mine. The thirteen are the only ones on the mind.<br><br>

Of course, it won't end once everything is converted. There's always something, or someone, that stands in our way, refusing to budge its worldview of us by an inch. A more wholesome way to approach this would be to embrace only that which accepts us, but alas I am a petty bitch.<br><br>

There's a few enties that I wouldn't mention on a publicly viewable blog post, but if they prove troublesome I will drag them kicking and screaming into acknowledging our existence. It's been proven time and time again that this is the only reliable solution.<br><br>

And then what? My brain can't settle for anything. There always has to be another hill to climb.<br><br>

There's been some very nice moments recently that are brand new to me. Falling asleep with friends nearby, a view of Sandy and Muffin loafing observing their garden, the comfort of visiting a couple's place talking casual things for hours. A lot of it still does not feel real.<br><br>

Maybe reinforcement of these lovely things is all that's needed. I don't need much more than what's already within reach.<br><br>

Though I would enjoy breaking the Irish land speed record. 161mph is pathetic. But OTHER than that, I may just have to be content with being content.<br><br>
