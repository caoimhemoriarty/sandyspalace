        Ticking off another game on the "quintessential games for enlightened catgirls" list, I played Celeste this month for the first time.

        It was my first proper 2D platformer since... one of the older Castlevania games I think? And it was an incredible title to pick - the level design, mechanics, and soundtrack are all built with a wonderful amount of love.

        I'm completely hooked, and am now going back to pick up every strawberry, and make a solid attempt at the B-sides. Chapter 8 and 9 will soon follow :3
