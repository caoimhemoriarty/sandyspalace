title: Small Site Updates

<div>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>A quick check showed that Sandy's Palace was consuming 404kB of data transfer on page load. This is shocking, unacceptable, and appalling. I have culled this number down to under 200xkB to protect myself from being assasinated from the Javascript-hating mob I foolishly created in my head.</li>
    <li>Made the first new additions to the webring this year. Very much enjoyed looking through these sites.</li>
    <li>Considered updating my 88x31, then decided against it. It's funnier the more basic it is. Unless I can figure out how to animate 88x31 gifs, then I'm unstoppable (someone please tell me how to do this)</li>
</ul>
