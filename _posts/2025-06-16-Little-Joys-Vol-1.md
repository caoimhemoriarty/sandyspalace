    This is a silly little thing that popped into my head today. I would like to write about the small things that give me far more enjoyment than they should.<br><br>
    
    Similarly, the act of writing about it would give me a badly needed positivity push. The other thoughts I would put words to were worse; this is preferable for everyone involved.<br><br>

    This week I was able to convert a friend-of-a-friend into a friend. Being in newfound proximity to so many cool people is one of my favourite blessings that has ever happened to me.<br><br>

    Among some trinkets and cool things she brought over were these Danish liquorice sweets - one of them standard, one of them pre-salted. I nabbed the pre-salted ones.<br><br>

    I haven't had liquorice since I was a kid, didn't particularly like it then, found it too strong. They somehow avoided me for twenty-ish years. So I thought it'd be a neat opportunity to try them out in a new context.<br><br>

    I made the dire mistake of chewing into the first few I tried - do not do this. Suck for at least 30 seconds. Insert a joke of your choice here.<br><br>
    
    They are utterly bizarre. Not quite tasting like liquorice that I've ever had before, nor liquorice that's had salt added into it. Another, possibly more horrifying, thing. Still unsure.<br><br>

    Regardless, a cool little thing that I try out every day, and discover a different aspect to it every time.<br><br>

    (Some research surfaced that the German language version of these treats are not allowed to be given to children, which also made me laugh.)<br><br>

    I played Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4 last week and this week. The bar was high, but it was almost certainly always going to be great.<br><br>

    Naturally, Toby served us up another couple of blinders. Chapter 3 is good fun, though not quite hitting the peaks of Chapter 2 - Queen was always going to be unbeatable. Chapter 4 throws us into the proper story of Deltarune, but reserves time to fuck around with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZNO0FmyZ0U">delightful boss fights</a>.<br><br>

    Fun new fact - I now hum this theme when enjoying bothering someone :3 <br><br>

    I'm enjoying and appreciating physical contact with people for the first time in my life. Very new and very heartfelt.<br><br>

    Muffin had his first birthday last week. I still want to do a huge page on this site for him, and another for Sandy. The little bastards deserve them :3<br><br>

    <a href="https://sandyspalace.ie/2025/03/09/Say-Hi-To-Takumi-The-Toyota-GT86.html">Takumi</a> gets a great audience from some kids I pass on the street.<br><br>

    Passing some kids just leaving school, one of them belts out a "REV IT!!!!!" and I'm obliged to give Takumi maximum beans. Seeing him cheer in my rear view mirror made me laugh for a good week.<br><br>

    Another kid walked past my driveway as I was letting Takumi idle on high, and I see him run over to his dad, then back to me, giving me a little hand signal to rev it. How could I not?<br><br>
