<p class="bolded">I'm of the opinion that a properly good piece of media, at least one that doesn't rely on "twists", cannot be spoiled in a meaningful way. If you disagree, avoid this post until after you read HWBM.</p>

    <p><blockquote> Through gravity, humans are ruled by each other. Anti-matter, anti-gravity, anti-culture; all exists as a resistive force to this gravity. The refusal of humanity to accept these parts of itself cause its own undoing. When we let our children develop in the lightness of space, they chose their bodies, genders, souls, hearts of their own volition. They became human in the ways they wished to become human.</blockquote></p>

    <p><blockquote>We love these places anyway. They're becoming more and more like home. All we need are more of us.<br><br>And they come, descending in waves, trying to take us back. We beat them back every time, and sometimes one or two look around, and decide "I'd rather stay here." And then there's more of us.<br><br>Sometimes they succeed, and take one of us back home. That's just as fine with us. We should go where we wish, live as we wish, and if our sisters get taken home, they bring a small part of us back to the Earth. That can't go unchanged.</blockquote></p>

    <p><blockquote>>I want us to be together forever.<br>>In our beautiful shapes in space, free.<br>>With everyone.<br><br>Of course, it isn't possible, Not enough people will believe in it. Earth is the primary body of this system, and the medium point between our gravity and its gravity is still deep within the Earth.<br><br>Yet, they cannot pull us down any more. That will never happen. We are still in space, and the future is uncertain, if we can even sustain it, but...</blockquote></p>

    <p><blockquote>The future of humanity as we know it depends on it. For that, they'll annihilate hers without hate, with only human efficiency and uncomplicated thoughts in mind.</blockquote></p>

Would we spend our lives without ever-<br><br>>We'd have found another way. Somehow. In Earth or space, no one is ever born whole. We got there eventually, didn't we?<br><br>>Ha, I think so too. So I would like to believe that no matter what, we could live and be happy?<br>>Even in mortal bodies, on our boring, awful home.<br>>I mean, they can't undo what we have done.<br>>When they take us back, they will have to make us a part of them.</blockquote></p>

    <p><blockquote> In time, the shape conforms to the human inside. This in part confirms the specific theory: the human part isn't the ear, but the hole in the lobes for your earrings, lipstick is real, lips are not, and we see humanity defined in its gravitational output.</blockquote></p>

    <p><blockquote>Her insistence on incorporation, rather than rejection, of existentially threatening elements was the fundamental cause of her failure to attract mainstream acceptance of her theories. Dr. Nix decried the narrow-minded individuals who let petty prejudice narrow their conception of what could or should count as human. While in her view, humanity should encompass all that is and all that is not, others believed that the fundamental division was crucial to the definition of humanity. That is, to be something means not to be other things.</blockquote></p>
