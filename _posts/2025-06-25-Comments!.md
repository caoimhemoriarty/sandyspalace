    I'm pleased to announce that this gay little website has a comment section now!<br><br>

    Big thanks to Caoimhe (no not me the other one, not Other Caoimhe I mean the original one) for hosting a <a href="https://comentario.app/">Commentario</a> instance that could handle adding Sandy's Palace as well.<br><br>

    I'd looked into comment sections before, but couldn't get my existing servers to share a seedbox domain and a website/comments domain consistently - which is why I outsourced the website portion of things to GitHub Pages.<br><br>

    Comments will be enabled for most pages apart from when they're not üëç<br><br>

    Also my profile name is 'Caoimhe M' as I was not the first person to hold this mantle. This may get more complicated once I convince Caoimhe B to join the shitposting fray, we shall see...
