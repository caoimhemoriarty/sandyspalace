        The initial opening line here was complaining at how the all-caps didn't render properly on the home page, until it just did. I'm not ignoring this.
    </p>
    <p>
        This supposedly simple project has been rendered excruciatingly difficult at every single stage by this utter piece of shit. In no particular order:
        <ul>
            <li>Documentation is totally at odds with GitHub Pages tutorials, despite Jekyll being the recommended site builder tool</li>
            <li>Directories and files that should have been generated with 
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">jekyll new my-awesome-site</code></pre></figure>
just... weren't. Their own documentation then expects you to be working with files that simply don't exist, and make no mention of how/where to create them</li>
            <li>Most themes built for Jekyll are not supported by GitHub Pages, nobody mentions this until far too late</li>
            <li>Compatability between Ruby's gems and Bundler is appalling. I have two different versions of so many things, which is gonna cause huge problems down the road</li>
            <li>Whoever wrote the documentation for Liquid needs to be beaten to death, as an act of sympathy and mercy</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        However we are here, with a functioning page on GitHub Pages, mostly because I gave up on hosting it on a dedicated server that also hosted a Swizzin seedbox. Far too many Nginx overrides meant I couldn't get the domain name to point to Sandy's Palace properly, so I've split the two, and left the seedbox to fester on its own IP address.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite all forces in the universe trying to make it otherwise, I am committed to this being a fun and gay little website. Until I meet the Jekyll devs.
