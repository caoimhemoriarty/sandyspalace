        I'm permitting use of a tiny amount of Javascript, to test out comment sections and seeing what's the easiest implementation.

        The criteria is simple:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No Disqus</li>
        <li>That's it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Test #1 is using Utterances, which integrates nicely into GitHub, which was already hosting the site to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main obvious downside is that GitHub authentication is required to comment, rather than allowing pseudo-anonymous comments. Anyone who doesn't have a GitHub account will be unable to tell me that this idea is shit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given that this test therefore has a guaranteed 100% satisfaction rate among commenters, I see it staying ðŸ˜Ž
