        At this point I still haven't typed up an explanation of my F1 archiving and distribution work, so out of context this will appear even more insane than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
        Long story short, I've been building up a rather popular niche in the high seas community. My archive of F1 media is solid, comparable to plenty of other buffs around the world, but I've made a commitment to sharing it as widely as possible, for as long as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's more of a long-term safe storage solution, as most casual internet users won't go beyond a simple stream. But for those willing to make the extra effort, I've been making some great progress on building up the greatest archive of F1 media imagineable, one totally impossible within the confines of archaic copyright law.
    </p>
    <p>
        There's still years to go. But I receive the most wonderful messages from people online. Some talk about reliving their childhood memories watching their first ever season, decades on. Others have found special moments they never even knew existed in the sport. And some just love the archiving work.
    </p>
    <p>
        These are my toughest customers, and also my favourites. Because at no point before in my life did I ever think I'd receive a message on Reddit from a stranger, offering me the inaugural race of the 1985 Formula 3000 season with such eagerness. And I was always going to say yes please and thank you.
    </p>

        The fellow crackheads continue their relentless assault. Three different collectors have come forward - two for F1, one for MotoGP. We will argue over broadcaster feeds, commentary tracks, video encoding standards. Together we will comb and merge everything, and create a work even more comprehensive than last year. And then we'll do it again, and again, and again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Such wonderful situations pose the most wonderful problems. Such as - how the fuck can I keep effectively storing this stuff? And how the hell am I going to have all the time to work through this?
    </p>

        FOM wishes they had our freedom.
