After my <a href="https://sandyspalace.ie/2025/08/11/WPlace-Shitposting-General.html">part 1 post</a> having initial fun with <a href="https://wplace.live/">WPlace</a>, I've been trying to branch out a bit more from painting and maintaining some existing pride flags.<br /><br />

I still keep an eye on the pride flags though. They get defaced pretty frequently, and there's a concerted push to paint pedophile flags on/around pride flags in an attempt to smear them. Much like real life, our existence is a constant battle on every front.<br /><br />

My online friend hasn't noticed the gay little message I left in her hometown. Don't wanna tell her outright, but the area is becoming increasingly busy and I don't wanna miss my chance either.<br /><br />

A friend of mine drew her custom Pokemon trainer which I thought was super cool. It was modelled off Kris and the Youngster from Pokemon Crystal, and comes off really well in WPlace. A lovely combination of cute art and a personal touch. I'm doing similar in that I'm drawing pixel art of my favourite Pokemon, but rather a dream team combination of my 6 favourites, complete with my favourite trainer design - Rosa, unsurprisingly. Really pleased with how this turned out.<br /><br />

I'm probably a bit burnt out after that one. I'll probably wind down my activities, as long as my city doesn't fall to 4Chan raids. What year is it, anyway?
