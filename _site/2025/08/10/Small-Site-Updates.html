<ul>
    <li>A quick check showed that Sandy's Palace was consuming 404kB of data transfer on page load. This is shocking, unacceptable, and appalling. To avoid being cubed by the Javascript-hating mob I foolishly created in my head, this needs to go down. I've culled it to below 300kB with some easy changes, unfortunately <a href="https://sneil.neocities.org/">Nora's</a> very cute 88x31 gif now takes up a third of the page size. This will be tolerated :3</li>
    <li>Made the first new additions to the Cool Site buttons this year. Very much enjoyed looking through these sites. Plenty more to come.</li>
    <li>Considered updating my 88x31, then decided against it. It's funnier the more basic it is. Unless I can figure out how to animate 88x31 gifs, then I'm unstoppable (someone please show me how to do this)</li>
    <li>Deliberated randomising the Cool Site button order, then decided to keep it mostly ordered in terms of people I know first. Also couldn't be arsed engineering that one without using Javascript. Don't know that many people IRL with blogs, gotta work on that</li>
</ul>
Still considering should I post about projects that are identifiable to me IRL. Will err on the side of caution, though it'd be nice to have more links on the home page.
