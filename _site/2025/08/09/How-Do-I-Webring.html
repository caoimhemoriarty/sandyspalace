I'm finally moving beyond repetitive thoughts on improving Sandy's Palace's homepage.<br /><br />

Fundamentally it's fine - I like straightforward. And it stays true to my goal of minimal bullshit, and only things that I want. Some silly one-liners, blog summary, links to RSS, links to cool stuff, all working ok.<br /><br />

The list of other cool sites isn't great. I populated it once when building the site in late-2024, added two buttons for people I found via another friend's site, then one from a friend I knew IRL, then just kinda stopped. Not that I don't enjoy travsering people's silly little blogs, but mentally the energy wasn't there.<br /><br />

So I am making a concerted push to trawl through more blogs - primarily for entertainment, and secondarily to add more cool things to my webring. I think that'd be more sustainable. Maybe hardcap myself at 5 blogs per session, and actually delve into them, rather than surface-level aesthetic comparison.<br /><br />

I'm familiar with the <a href="https://cohost-highway.neocities.org/webring">Cohost Highway</a>, a continuation of the wonderful spirit of Cohost that I was tantalisingly close to but never fully committed to. But I would love to discover other curated webrings and build up my enthusiasm again.<br /><br />

I was gonna wrap up this post with a joke, then noticed that one of my friends changed their name and I'm too excited about this to think straight ok bye
