I'm finally moving beyond repetitive thoughts on improving Sandy's Palace's homepage.<br /><br />

Fundamentally it's fine - I like straightforward. And it stays true to my goal of minimal bullshit, and only things that I want. Some silly one-liners, blog summary, links to RSS, links to cool stuff, all working ok.<br /><br />

The webring isn't great. I populated it once when building the site in late-2024, added two buttons for people I found via another friend's site, then one from a friend I knew IRL, then just kinda stopped. Not that I don't enjoy travsering people's silly little blogs, but mentally the energy wasn't there.<br /><br />

So I am making a concerted push to trawl through more blogs - primarily for entertainment, and secondarily to add more cool things to my webring. I think that'd be more sustainable. Maybe hardcap myself at 5 blogs per session, and actually delve into them, rather than surface-level aesthetic comparison.<br /><br />

I'm familiar with the <a href="https://cohost-highway.neocities.org/webring">Cohost Highway</a>, a continuation of the wonderful spirit of Cohost that I was tantalisingly close to but never fully committed to. But I would love to discover other curated webrings and build up my enthusiasm again.<br /><br />

I was gonna wrap up this post with a joke, then noticed that one of my friends changed their name and I'm too excited about this to think straight ok bye

I enjoy giggling and teeheeheeing a normal amount. It gets far funnier the more egregious the context is.<br /><br />

I also enjoy Formula 1 a normal amount, and of the many things that have accumulated in my mind is the enjoymemt of elite sportspeople being delightfully silly. Fernando Alonso is the definition of this, bending the rules and outright breaking them for twenty-plus years, with the most babygirl expression on his face as he pretends he had no idea about the plan to stage a deliberate crash.<br /><br /> 

One of my favourite moments comes from 1999. British American Tobacco had poured millions into their new child, complete with a star-studded driver lineup, engineers purchased from across the world, and swathes of flashy sponsors. Unfortunately they didn't account for their two drivers engaging in a bet to see who could tackle a steep 250kph+ corner at full throttle.

<p>

Millions of dollars ruined, a race weekend thrown out the window, and all but egos unharmed. I think Jock Clear at the end summarises the mood best.<br /><br />

Moving on to a man who has defined F1 rulebooks to the extent that they've had to invent multiple new ones just to stop his bullshit. Michael Schumacher, in the middle of a furiously competitive qualifying session at Monaco, had a bright idea mid-lap as to how to ruin his opponent's final attempt to dethrone him. The most enjoyable bit is observing how bad he is at acting bad. The Italian hand gestures, and stalling despite his left hand clearly on the brake bias dial rather than the clutch, is icing on the cake.<br /><br />

The driver impeded at the end of the clip? Fernando Alonso. Wonder where he got it from later in life.<br /><br />

Anyways this shit makes me giggle and I am committing to submerging you all in inane content until I'm satisfied :3

I am afflicted with a deadly illness that has ruined my life. It's called Walking At A Normal Fucking Speed and cripples my ability to function in society.<br /><br />

I claim to minimise my time in public spaces because of loud noise, overstimulation, overheating, and health concerns. Truthfully it's because me getting stuck behind a three-child pram for more than a microsecond results in authoritarian thoughts of cubing everyone who stands in my way.<br /><br /> 

People who sprint across the road just to screech to a halt in front of me and stare at their phone deserve nothing more than forced labour camps. Able-bodied people who move at the pace of tectonic plates shall be given exoskeletons that I remotely control to forcibly speed them up on footpaths.<br /><br />

(This is all far funnier when you consider I'm 5ft 6" and my left leg is two inches shorter than my right)<br /><br />

Supermarkets are the worst for all of these combined. Why I haven't moved to online deliveries and click-and-collect ranges from excuses such as "I want an excuse to drive Takumi" to "Tesco gave me the wrong type of tomato and now I'm considering domestic terrorism."<br /><br />

Dunnes is hell on earth. It has everything in stock, meaning the large food shops are done here, meaning the bills are often €200+, then the arguing over vouchers is excruciating. Dante Alighieri did not envision a middle-aged mother forcing the entire queue to shuffle out of her way three separate times for her to stare at chocolate bars to push her bill up to a certain amount such that her vouchers covered more, only to realise she miscalculated the amounts, proceeding to argue with the cashier over price labels, then finding half her vouchers were different to what she thought, THEN loading her shopping into the trolley for the subsequent five minutes. But if he did, Inferno would have ten circles.<br /><br />

SuperValu is a nursing home. I am not attuned to John-and-Mary culture at the best of times, but visiting here could be a documentary. Also the car park is a war zone fought by tortoises.<br /><br />

Tesco operates one human-staffed till, and five morbillion self-checkouts visited entirely by cataconic dudebros. Also I refuse on principle to get a Clubcard to get the actual prices.<br /><br />

Aldi and moreso Lidl should be more to my taste. I meet the cashier's eye, they challenge me to a duel, then proceed to sling my shopping at lightning speeds through the register while I make a mediocre attempt to keep up. A brief sniff of victory is all they display. Which is great fun, but neither of them have good fish. Or vegetables. Or snacks. Or spices.<br /><br />

And here rests my problem. I desire a supermarket designed from scratch for people who know what they're getting, get the thing, pay for the thing, then evaporate into mist. With aisles curated for the actual separation of food types, not forcing the essential stuff into alternating corners of the warehouse. Alas no overpaid executive sees my vision.<br /><br /> 

In completely unrelated news, I scored full marks on an autism assessment for the first time in that psychiatrist's career. Please clap.

I am a huge fan of characters that don't speak very much or at all. This may not come as a huge surprise.<br /><br />

Even better when they can hold their own, without any compromises to their character or what they're trying to achieve. There is motivation here for me that outstrips pretty much anything else a piece of media could say.<br /><br />

Kimiko from the TV show The Boys has been a treat to watch. There is clear reason in her silence, which adds to her character rather than detracts or constrains it. Also she's cute when she rips people's heads off :3 <br /><br />

Moving to, as my friend has ungenerously put it before, a show for babies: Miraculous Ladybug has Kagami whom I attune with a very normal amount. She does talk, but only when necessary and saying only what's needed. Plenty of examples of this in media, I just stumbled upon this one and quite enjoy it.<br /><br />

This is where the trend ends for fictional characters whose names begin with K and are 6 characters long. I am very interested in continuing this mind you.<br /><br />

<figure style="margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">

</figure>

Something about Komi from Komi-san Can't Communicate didn't click with me. It felt permanently like an attempt to be adorable to the ogling reader, before any point it tried to deliver.<br /><br />

Shōko Nishimiya	from Koe no Katachi wrecked me when I first watched it almost a decade ago. It's been too long to remember the subtleties, but it hits too close to home for me to call it my favourite rendition of this thought. Good film though.<br /><br />

A search online for mute characters pulled up Shizune Hakamichi, who comes from a time where I was shitposting on corners of the internet that I would rather erase. So that one's a bit cursed still. Also her route was SHIT<br /><br />

Chell, Doomguy, and Gordon Freeman all fit the bill, but I don't feel it as much with video game protagonists. Maybe there's this expectation that they don't <i>have</i> to speak in that type of media. I can't immediately think of nonverbal NPCs, though this would likely appeal to me far more.<br /><br />

Most words I speak are weighed down with unease, and the sense that I'm always a step behind what I'm <i>supposed</i> to say feels inescapable. The more casual the talk, the worse it becomes. I don't understand how anyone can reach deep into their decades of knowledge, pull out the exact silly media fact or quip required, and belt it out all in a microsecond. By the time I've stewed over a sentence long enough to trust it, we're talking about anarchist communes or some shit.<br /><br />

The thought of dropping it all feels nice. Even with the knowledge that I'd lose that necessary connection to people that's (mostly) required to get closer to them.<br /><br />

It remains unrealistic. I'd have to drop too much from my life to be able to continue with stability. So I watch these fictional little characters and squee with glee and envy.

In 2015 I spent €120 on a laptop with the physical properties of a battering ram. Tachanka has served me for 10 glorious years, and he has finally been allowed to rest after much faithful service.<br /><br />

Tachanka the Thinkpad T410 has no outrageous tech specs to speak of. i5-520M, 2GB RAM, 250GB HDD, TFT LCD screen. Where he becomes outstanding is the way it's all put together. Everything is socketed, not soldered, into place. Virtually every component is hot-swappable, and a surprising proportion of them can be done while the machine is still running. A full magnesium shell shrouds the heart, still indestructible despite my best efforts.<br /><br />

<figure style="margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">
<img src="/assets/images/blog/tachanka-1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;" />
<figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">You wish your laptop was also a landline phone so bad it makes you look stupid</figcaption>
</figure>

Almost everything got upgraded, bar the CPU. Several years and some lost screws later, Tachanka was rocking 8GB RAM, 1TB of SSD storage, doubled battery capacity, and a lightweight Linux distro that gave zero fucks about raw processing power.<br /><br />

His drawback - massive weight - was also his party piece, as you could drop him on a table with zero disregard for the subsequent earthquake. Glass tables were for weaklings anyway.<br /><br />

The foolish masses never understood. Tachanka was the equivalent of a Mercedes Grosser, delightfully overengineered. Unfortunately my D&amp;D group did not appreciate my ability to reload the spare SATA slot like an AK-47:<br /><br />

<p>
    <video controls="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">This reload could have been done in 5 seconds if I wasn't frothing with rage</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </video>
<p>

I used him as a daily driver far beyond his usual shelf life, having been manufactured in 2010 and running happily until 2023. However the troubles eventually began to pile up.<br /><br />

The keyboard had to be removed every time you needed to access the front of the motherboard, and the clips had loosened and weakened the corners. The screen's ability to rotate 180 degrees had worn out the hinges. The ability to charge him became inconsistent, and it dropped power on rare occasions.<br /><br />

The charging issue became so troublesome, I had to perform a few operations. The first, a full disassembly, attempted to find any loose wires or other easy fixes. No such luck of course. The second operation was an attempt to replace some core cables, strip the machine to its bare insides (hot), and try jump-starting it under various conditions.<br /><br />

<figure style="margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">
<img src="/assets/images/blog/tachanka-2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;" />
<figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">About halfway through the operation</figcaption>
</figure>

When it became clear that no accessory was causing problems, I resorted to changing the charging port and some electrical sections. No luck. Either I'd missed something, or the issue was on a main board that was discontinued over a decade ago.<br /><br />

With Tachanka already in a million pieces, I made the brave decision to keep the core components and scrap the rest. No modern machine uses a magnesium shell anyways.<br /><br />

I have no idea what to do with a BGA1288-socketed CPU. But if I thought of something cool, it might keep Tachanka still kicking in a sense. I have a drawer full of CPUs, maybe some weird art piece could work.

April 7th, 2024. Wrestlemania 40, the opening act of Night 2. A 6ft buff Scotsman struts down the catwalk to the ring, through a saber arch with bagpipes blasting. I turn to my friend and remark that this is the dumbest shit I've ever seen, with a big smile on my face.<br /><br />

His opponent, another 6ft buff lad, continues his tradition of dressing himself by running through his wife's curtains. They kind of dropped this gimmick in 2025, unfortunately. I miss Mardi Gras Seth Rollins.<br /><br />

They pretend to kick the shit out of each other for 10 minutes, mostly by actually throwing each other around in increasingly wacky scenarios, with the Scotsman taking a brief break to send a tweet mid-match. <a href="https://x.com/dmcintyrewwe/status/1777114915678937236">Not a joke</a>.<br /><br />

Scotsman wins, before becoming the definition of hubris by mocking another rival in the commentary box to the extent that he gets beaten up for shits and giggles, before the Money In The Bank holder (winner of a silly match that gives the holder an instant no-questions-asked world championship match on demand) sprints into the ring, performs the world's quickest ass-kicking, steals the title off him and leaves. This proceeds to set off the biggest feud of 2024, containing several months of the most idiot babygirl promos, and three banger matches. It's funnier the less I explain.<br /><br />

This, and many other idiotic storylines, has confirmed to me the theory that professional wrestling is advanced drag. The wrestlers are playing complete caricatures, love to show off skin, are supremely talented in ways that aren't immediately obvious, and have extremely tacky soundtracks following them around. Prove me wrong.<br /><br />

The more indie you go, the sillier it gets. Turn to AEW for blood matches, storylines that revolve around being bald, and the single greatest kayfabe actor of all time (MJF). Turn to the national indies (in my case, OTT) for shouting "you fat bastard" at a ripped British dude while a big schmeaty Irish lad is doing a striptease to rapturous applause. We love and support Big Damo around here. Also there's a lad who's main gimmick is vaping in the middle of matches.<br /><br />

</figure>

You can't force yourself to enjoy it, it's just utter nonsense that one day may or may not make sense. And it makes you look like a lunatic if you try to explain it. Hi btw &lt;3 <br /><br />

For almost a full year I carried the tradition of McIntyre Monday, a weekly celebration of why you the worshipper were so much better than everyone else. Drew was in the middle of his heel run and it just made sense. It made for strangely satisfying motivation. Also Drew (real name Andrew) is a real-life babygirl who goes to cat cafes and looks after all the women wrestlers when travelling and on nights out. Great dude to support.<br /><br />

The interest has dropped off a bit recently - WWE is having a poor run, and is politically rancid. AEW is picking itself up after a weak few months. OTT is only up in Dublin even if I'd like to go up maybe once a year. But it's still delightfully stupid and makes me laugh.<br /><br />

Happy McIntyre Monday bitches. No I don't care if it's Wednesday it's a state of mind you fool

I've been free for 1086 days. There's nothing particularly special about the round numbers, nor the annual anniversaries. It was simply nice to realise.<br /><br />

"Free" is relative. I was worse off for many of those early days. But overall it's been a lovely time period to reflect on.<br /><br />

Sandy has been in my life for 1038 days. He has been a wonderful little tether of motivation.<br /><br />

I've had a stable roof over my head for 656 days. Acutely conscious of how fortunately the cards played out on this one. Many of us weren't that lucky. But whatever hand I had to play in it, I'm happy with.<br /><br />

I've been on HRT for 652 days. By far the most influential act of my life, and also one of the best. Still in the early game with this one :3<br /><br />

591 days since my first piercing. I left the shop already giddy for the next one. 340 days since my most recent ones. The cuntiness is still a work in progress but I grow happier and happier with it.<br /><br />

488 days since my first laser appointment. Still stings a bit. Worth it.<br /><br />

477 days since I had my moment of realisation that professional wrestling was the biggest dumbest shit ever and I loved it. Just felt nice to put something silly on this list. There's a specific story I can tell another time.<br /><br />

224 days since an intense awakening of mine. This is a public site and I will say no more. Teehee.<br /><br />

117 days since I called a long-distance friend of mine for the first time. We yapped about fashion, surgeries, cuddles, and bread.<br /><br />

34 days of legally being Caoimhe.<br /><br />

I've been in a safer place for 1086 days. At the same time, more vulnerable, excited, timid, loving, fearful, enthusiastic, rattled, motivated. Everything is more intense now. There is too much to do, and too many people to cling onto for dear life. But this will always beat a black hole and a dead end.

I swear I was ahead of the curve on this one. But modern technology has run out of usefulness to me.<br /><br />

It was obvious enough with the kind of blog I run. Sandy's Palace is HTML and CSS only (apart from 2 lines but don't worry about it), a haphazardly-run shambling mass of a thing. I adore it because it's mine, and I made it mine.<br /><br />

Virtually no aspect of modern tech allows this any more. Smartphones are walled gardens, hemming you in with the power of convenience, sleekness, and obfuscation. If you're on Android, you can fight back, but you need to Know in order to even begin. If you're on iPhone, forget it.<br /><br />

Every item that can be enshittified is in the process of being turned into an appliance. Something designed to break whenever it feels like, totally unrepairable, leaving you powerless to take ownership and control.<br /><br /> 

Modern cars disgust me. I don't consider them appealing at any price bracket. Frankly the more high-end you go, the worse it gets. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/everything-we-learned-from-a-week-with-apple-carplay-ultra/">Apple CarPlay takes greater priority on a new Aston Martin than anything else it determines on the fly.</a> A surprising aspect of conspicuous consumption to me was that people will happily pay for an appliance that is shit at what it does, as it displays the user's affluence even more effectively, not even needing their pricey toy to work. Also see: Cybertruck.<br /><br />

I made the leap to digital banks and briefly enjoyed it. Then they added a tab for investments. Then for crypto. Then popups for savings goals, trending tickers, brand discounts, analytics, RevPoints, 'Benefits', premium tiers... Trade Republic doesn't even let me see cashback accumulation any more.<br /><br />

Complaining stops here. I try to only bitch when I can do something about it.<br /><br />

Cars - no buying anything that contains the word 'infotainment'. If there's a head unit, ensure it's isolated from the rest of the car. Then replace said head unit with your own CIA-backed puppet. Mechanical switches only for everything important: car controls, air conditioning, cruise control, and ideally the handbrake. Mechanical tach and speedometer is a must.<br /><br />

Banks - It's time to Retvrn to your local credit union. Unlike AIB, BOI, PTSB, etc, these guys bail <i>you</i> out.<br /><br />

Every home appliance must be fixable with a hammer and/or a blowtorch. No exceptions.<br /><br />

Once the banal stuff is out of the way, how do we enjoy ourselves?<br /><br />

Digital photography still has plenty of skill curve left for me to climb, but it doesn't feel fruitful any more. Once you hit a certain level of playing with settings on a screen, it all feels academic. The thought of approaching the same hobby while being forced to relearn how everything works - now that's fun. I desperately want to jump into this with a silly little €20 thing and actually fuck around and find out.<br /><br />

Cooking is unenshittifiable... right? Aside from online recipes. Make your own cookbook. And put chicken chasseur in there. You will thank me later.<br /><br />

I've never been good at arts and crafts, but if a cute girl taught me how to stitch and sew I'd be doing it all day everyday. Mostly to sew gay little patches onto things.<br /><br />

And saving all that, there's always domestic terrorism.<br /><br />

<b>Edit:</b> Forgot to mention. Streaming services are evil and Jellyfin servers are the gigachad solution 👍

Another WhatsApp notification buzzes. It's the family group chat, for the tenth time this morning. I swipe it away as always, but refuse to mute it.<br /><br />

I check the password manager daily for logins that still use my deadname. Thirteen. Four relate to work and are therefore stuck for the medium-term. Seven relate to companies that are stubborn, backwards, or just plain broken. Two are last-gasp backups.<br /><br />

Ignore the ninty-three victories, and the stray five logins that are stuck on a different name of mine. The thirteen are the only ones on the mind.<br /><br />

Of course, it won't end once everything is converted. There's always something, or someone, that stands in our way, refusing to budge its worldview of us by an inch. A more wholesome way to approach this would be to embrace only that which accepts us, but alas I am a petty bitch.<br /><br />

There's a few enties that I wouldn't mention on a publicly viewable blog post, but if they prove troublesome I will drag them kicking and screaming into acknowledging our existence. It's been proven time and time again that this is the only reliable solution.<br /><br />

And then what? My brain can't settle for anything. There always has to be another hill to climb.<br /><br />

There's been some very nice moments recently that are brand new to me. Falling asleep with friends nearby, a view of Sandy and Muffin loafing observing their garden, the comfort of visiting a couple's place talking casual things for hours. A lot of it still does not feel real.<br /><br />

Maybe reinforcement of these lovely things is all that's needed. I don't need much more than what's already within reach.<br /><br />

Though I would enjoy breaking the Irish land speed record. 161mph is pathetic. But OTHER than that, I may just have to be content with being content.<br /><br />
