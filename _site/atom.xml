<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt37441935/">Girls &amp; Boys</a> proposes a radical new train of thought: Can Trinity students be redeemed?<br /><br />

The path to redemption for Charlie (Liath Hannon) and Jason (Adam Lunnon-Collery) is aided primarily by their culchie accents, which makes every emotion delivered in the film far funnier. We need more of this.<br /><br />

Set over a single night in Dublin city, it touches on many aspects of the transfem experience, delves into macho rugby stereotypes and the personality suppression that inevitably follows, and highlights the eternal struggle of finding a reliable dealer on short notice. Overall a solid representation of the 21st century student lifestyle.<br /><br />

Liath Hannon is gorgeous and I will fawn over her for an extremely normal length of time. I have no idea what actions in her life led her to star in her first ever film, but I am very grateful for them. Her depiction of the transfem life nails a huge array of issues, anxieties, and fears, into 85 minutes. I wish we could have seen more expression of trans joy, but the plot didn't really allow for it.<br /><br />

Adam Lunnon-Collery does a good job of playing a stereotype that annoys me to hell - because I relate to it too much. Jason dodges meaningful questions, bases life decisions around the easy dependable route, and lacks the confidence to stand up for himself. Hence why he studies BESS<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>.<br /><br />

He does a solid job in sloppily hiding Jason's insecurities and past issues, resulting in delightful miscommunications and abandonments. By nature of wanting to punch past me in the face, I would also like to punch Jason in the face a similar amount. Sign of a good actor I suppose.<br /><br />

Actor Oisin Flynn handles the odious spiteful character Mark. His character's internship in the Irish Times was not explicitly shown but I see it in my heart.<br /><br />

The way various issues are presented throughout the film are done thoughtfully and mostly executed well. Donncha Gilmore did his homework and we are very appreciative for that.<br /><br />

In the first half, the main conflict is hinted at in many subtle ways. Almost everyone I've spoken to picked up on this via a different scene, or hint, or line of dialogue. Thinking about the first third of the film again, it takes on an interestingly different profile as a result.<br /><br />

The second half focuses directly on the conflict and resolution. Outside of being a touch too cliche in one or two scenes, each character is given space to trade barbs and lay out a very relatable history of painful events. Too many to list, frankly.<br /><br />

This post is mostly redundant as only the Lighthouse cinema in Dublin is showing this for a few more days. But if the opportunity ever presents itself, Girls &amp; Boys can safely be added to the "Too Fucking Real" watchlist.

<h2><a href="https://blueberrylemonade.pika.page/posts/lets-make-up-fantasy-consoles-for-fun">Let’s make up fantasy consoles for fun</a></h2>
<blockquote>If you could wave a magic wand and wish a new fantasy console into the world…what would it be like? What constraints would it have to force developers to get creative? If it came with hardware, like the Playdate, what would the console physically be like?</blockquote>

I saw this a few weeks ago and loved the concepts. I've been on-off stewing over some ideas, but I think my first thought remains my favourite.<br /><br />

The DS and 3DS eras of Nintendo consoles had a stupendous long-term impact on console modding. Both, particularly the latter, are easy to bend to your will<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>, and can be supplanted with lovely choices of operating systems, software, and even emulation. This is a must - my dream console must have easily swappable hardware, and the software should be open to those who want to tinker away to their hearts content. Whatever a few hundred developers can achieve, the hundreds of thousands of fans should build on it in wonderful ways.<br /><br />

I'm also sticking with the split screen approach of the DS and 3DS. This was a radical design choice, and I have huge respect for games that experimented with this. Visual novels and other "passive" games could have the main activity on the top screen, and controls on the bottom, with the console providing an easy integration solution to avoiding screen clutter. Tactical and puzzle games often did similar. RPGs like Shin Megami Tensei<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[2]</a></sup> also fucked around and found out. It's very charming to me.<br /><br />

Accessibility is also critical. Modern phones, gaming controllers, etc, all demand dextrous hands to operate. I'm floored by how creative people become in their modding of games to be achievable (examples <a href="https://www.compusult.at/jouse">1</a>, <a href="https://quad.life/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fcK19CAjWM">3</a>, <a href="https://byowave.com/">4</a>), and to enable this further would be amazing. I don't think any default button configuration will ever fit most people's needs, but to allow this configuration - both in terms of physicial hardware and how the software interprets it - absolute freedom would be amazing. Similar to how <a href="https://frame.work">Framework laptops</a> allow for modular ports and slots, having this integrated into the surface of a game console, to allow you to switch in/out control types, would be really cool.<br /><br />

Going back to the DS and 3DS playbook, I do not care for massive hardware specs. If you want to put Crysis on this thing, do it yourself. Capping the hardware capabilities also mitigates an arms race of higher resolution textures, processing, rendering, that simply does not benefit the end product any more. So we're going 720p and you will like it. Get creative with your graphics again.<br /><br />

The closest console to broach these ideas might be the Steam Deck, which I respect Valve a lot for. Still, competition is always good.

<blockquote>You can usually see as far as your torchlight reaches,” Csaba says. “But if people touch the walls or kick up the silt on the bottom of the passages, visibility drops to zero very fast.</blockquote>
Another half-article, half-photoset, but a really cool one nonetheless.

<blockquote>that's all I have for now. thank you for reading. if you used cohost, thank you for having used cohost. I'm told it was like a website in there.</blockquote>
Cohost is an odd area of interest for me. I was adjacent to it during its existence, creating an account in its opening weeks, dipping my toes in and out like an indecisive kid, never fully committing.<br /><br />

If I had taken the plunge, and landed among the type of communities I (eventually) found on Tumblr, I likely would have found yet more delightful niches to enjoy. I hear that they certainly did exist there, even ones I had never before heard of.<br /><br />

Cohost is now gone, and the lamentation over its passing fascinates me. There is a genuine loss of communities that I haven't observed throughout the Twitter migration, nor through various eras of Tumblr collapses.<br /><br />

What websites remain?

<blockquote>In that sense, it’s not AI that will weaken every user’s critical thinking skills — but it might create a divide between people depending on whether it increases how much they engage with information, or reduces it. You can use AI as a springboard for ideas that spark creativity, or as a one-click replacement for creativity. Future AI agents may free up your working time to do more rewarding things, or it can embolden employers to demand that we “produce” more.</blockquote>
Every day I inch closer to being able to post my masterpiece on AI within Big Tech. This will do for now.<br /><br />

<blockquote>The feature that convinced me to start paying for Kagi was its Privacy Pass option. Based on a clean-sheet Rust implementation of the Privacy Pass standard (IETF RFCs 9576, 9577, and 9578) by Raphael Robert, this is a technology that uses cryptographic token-based auth to send an "I'm a paying user, please give me results" signal to Kagi, without Kagi knowing which user made the request. (There's a much longer Kagi blog post with actual technical details for the curious.)</blockquote>
Same as above re. my thoughts. I'm at the level of jadedness (read: age) where paying for a search engine seems increasingly viable.<br /><br />


<h2><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/for-some-people-music-doesnt-connect-with-any-of-the-brains-reward-circuits/">For some people, music doesn’t connect with any of the brain’s reward circuits </a></h2>

<blockquote>The first thing that’s uncertain is whether specific musical anhedonia is a stable trait. Is the disconnection in the brain that seemingly causes it permanent, or can it be modulated through some kind of training, therapy, or even pharmacological interventions? Pallarés and his colleagues are already busy working on these questions, having started by looking at our DNA.</blockquote>
I've read this article twice, and in both cases I had video game music playing in the background. Each time, I stopped and realised that the music did little for me.<br /><br />

Fresh from new thoughts after an autism assessment this week<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[3]</a></sup>, I've been thinking about repetitive loops that I put myself through; sometimes out of perceived benefit, and sometimes out of sheer routine that does nothing for me. I'm increasingly finding that music falls into the latter for me.<br /><br />

I wouldn't call it a deficiency or issue of any kind, more that it simply does nothing for me, and I don't care to push myself to enjoy what other people enjoy just to keep up. There's many examples of this for me, and it gets easier with age, practice, and good company.<br /><br />

Exposure to many new types of people and inclinations has been great in this regard for me. I wonder if an asexual person would read this article and feel any thread of connection to Pallarés' research. Would someone who feels no attachment to food feel the same? Might do a full post on this train of thought.

<h2><a href="https://www.sequencermag.com/cyborg-rights-depend-on-new-and-better-legal-protections/">Cyborg rights depend on new and better legal protections</a></h2>
<blockquote>A new kind of technology is necessary to disrupt the status quo— one that further obscures the traditional distinction between body and device. The subject of my last piece, the heart-powered pacemaker (also called TECH), may do just that, potentially offering legal protections for cyborgs.<br /><br />

A key challenge is defining what constitutes that body and the corresponding rights it should be granted. Even when legal rulings feel black and white, the language underpinning them concerns nebulous philosophical questions. How do we compare the degree of embodiment between all of the different kinds of medical devices in a fair and precise manner?</blockquote>
Given my interests, I thought I'd have more background knowledge on this. But I don't, and it's a fascinating discussion that will only intensify into the future.<br /><br />

The varying needs and wants of technology implanted into the body is stunningly broad. I hold a diverse range of positions on this scale, depending on what my upcoming cardiac and MRI scans will report. Closer to the "wants" side of things, I would absolutely modify the fuck out of myself at the first opportunity<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[4]</a></sup>.<br /><br />

If, voluntarily or otherwise, I'm in a position where mechanical implants are essential to my continued wellbeing, do I still retain full legal control over myself?<br /><br />

A near-inverse thought - is there a risk that technology as a form of control could be strengthened by this movement? With the legal framework adjusted to protect "it" and not the host it's embedded into? There's very few real-life cases that come to mind. But I'm envisioning jobs that require augmented motor control (eg. exoskeletons for moving heavy items), or heightened senses (eg. a surgeon whose precision relies on perfected vision). If a corporation retains ownership of a device that's implanted into an employee, do they enjoy a higher degree of control over the individual via any future legislation?<br /><br />

I am confident in my view that there will eventually emerge a movement of people who wish to preserve the biological above the mechanical, holding a moral and ethical position that we should not be mandated to accept any kind of technological intrusion on the body. I strongly respect this position, and feel that this perspective is intertwined with the above debate. There are no easy answers.

Now you may be thinking: What is a title like that doing in the Light Reads section?<br /><br />
<blockquote> If personal things happening to Sonic is the theme of this sincerity amidst the chaos, then it is the most appropriate thing in the romhack that the final overworld event, after Sonic completes “Masterpiece” the level, is the revealing of letters spelling out “your gay.” Again humorous, especially with its purposeful misspelling, but also an honest revelation of the self.

It's been almost two years since I moved into my house. This used to be an area of severe insecurity for me, and the feeling never really leaves. So I'm quite pleased with how it turned out.<br /><br />

The house is named after Sandy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>, naturally. I thought getting a place without a garden would upset him. So I turned down a tiny red-brick house closer to town<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[2]</a></sup>, and a terraced city-centre hideaway around the corner from my old flat<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[2]</a></sup>.<br /><br />

Instead I chose a "maturing" neighbourhood. In non-estate-agent terms, a former council housing estate that's less rough than even a decade ago. The upsides being that the garden's huge<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[3]</a></sup>, the price was manageable, and it has a driveway: an increasing rarity in modern builds. And I like Takumi too much :3 <br /><br />

The downside was that the previous owner left the place like shit. Even in the eight months between the viewing and moving in, the garden had become totally overgrown, interior was not cleaned once, and there were horrors perfectly within my comprehension buried in the back garden. Fuck you [REDACTED].<br /><br />

It's taken a stupid amount of time, effort, and money to get it fixed up to the extent where I can host people. But after the final big project, I think we're finally there.<br />

The kitchen was the first room I looked into when I opened the front door for the first time. The floor was coated in layers of dirt, mostly carried from outside, via the previous owner's moving crew who deposited half the garden soil around the house.<br /><br />

Pictures do not convey the level of dirt on everything: the cupboard doors, handles, inside of the oven, <b>everything</b>.

I ripped this bitch to shreds only last month, via the following steps:<br />
<ul>
  <li>Pulling the wall tiles off - this required re-plastering of the wall in certain areas. Not fully completed as the right-hand side of this room will have new tiles put on. Left side is to be scraped and painted.</li>
  <li>Tearing out the original ceiling, fully replastering it, with integrated lighting</li>
  <li>Annihilate the old appliances and furniture from existence, and install new Ikea furnishings. Ikea quality is fine, perfectly befitting of a small room that will hopefully be extended and retrofitted in another decade or two.</li>
  <li>Entirely new appliances across the board. Mostly Bosch apart from the fridge freezer cos that shit's pricey. Magnetic induction hob is a treat and I love it</li>
</ul>

There's also some strip lighting for the countertop which was a neat addition. Pretty sure I didn't request it but Ikea added it anyways. Decent spend of €100.

This was absolute hell to work on from start to finish. When there were contractors in to help with the floorboards, one of them later confessed to me "I nearly burst into tears".<br /><br />

The existing floor was comprised of destroyed lino, secured via chipboard that was glued directly onto the floorboards. Every single one of these elements was in dire condition. You might be able to pull the lino off the chipboard, but hammers, chisels, and power tools couldn't pull most of the chipboard off.<br /><br />

You may notice the wall tiles don't reach the floor. This is because some of the pipes were added afterwards, and the previous owner decided to just shove them into a section that wouldn't fit them. Also see the top corner where they inserted a pipe through the ceiling with the help of a cluster grenade.<br /><br />

Also the shower was falling apart and leaking directly onto the floor and through the floorboards.<br /><br />

Every single item in this room had to be brand new. There's some cheaper items (toilet and radiator are on the budget side) but everything else was pretty nice. The tiles ended up working out really well - big cream ones on the floor are easy to clean, and the blue for the shower was a bit of a gamble but worked out ok.<br /><br />

Even the walls are new. There's waterproof membrane installed behind the tiles, which does make the room ultimately smaller, but eliminates moisture issues.<br /><br />

The light has day/night functions that I never use, but I appreciate the thought.<br /><br />

Also I may have put a lot of the budget into a good shower. Teehee.

"The Orange Room", as my then-partner put it. Originally I tried a forest green on the walls, and found it dimmed the brightness too much. So we went with an ochre red that was initially trialled in the guest bedroom.<br /><br /> 

Also I did paint that final wall in ochre red, after a few weeks of doing nothing about it. Brighter than it looks.<br /><br />

Most of the dirt in the carpet comes from a fireplace in the corner. Why a fireplace was being ignited in a room containing only a tumble dryer and a treadmill, I do not know. Cream carpets were used for all of the upstairs bedrooms, and work pretty well.<br /><br />

One feature of this brand of council house is that the gas boiler is situated in a small sub-room within the rear-facing bedroom. Which the plumbers all find quite amusing.<br /><br />

That bedframe was my one treat for myself in this room. A stupidly-good-quality mattress is up next.<br /><br />

Plenty of wall decorations later went up - mostly artwork from local artists. I also got some art prints from the Crawford Art Gallery that I still need to put up.<br /><br />

Probably the easiest room to improve. Floorboards needed no modification to fit carpets on top, two layers of paint did the walls, and triple-glazed windows (not pictured) were sufficient.<br /><br />

Another council house oddity - that storage on the left links directly to a ventilation hole in the exterior wall. So this took some amateur DIY to plug up and stop everything from freezing in winter. Bizarre architectural choice.

<h2>Other Works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The front bedroom isn't pictured here because the current occupier moved their stuff in before I could get a good pic</li>
  <li>This house had the worst possible energy efficiency rating when I moved in. Triple-glazed windows at the front (rear already had double-glazed) and new exterior doors is my progress to-date. Next step would be exterior wall insulation, which is prohibitively expensive. Like €15,000 expensive.</li>
  <li>Living room didn't need much work apart from new couches and armchairs</li>
  <li>Garden work is still ongoing. Maybe to be finished this winter. Maybe.</li>
</ul>

I have a spreadsheet tracking the total spend on this house, and it's reached a horrifying number. But it's all been good investments so far. However, as the essential projects all get ticked off, my mind drifts towards catios at the back and flamethrower defences at the front. Teehee.<br /><br />

At this section of watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764362/">The Menu</a>, I was stumped for a minute. I had previously dined in Ichigo Ichie twice<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>, back when it ran a thirteen-course menu and carried a prestigious Michelin star. And in this moment, I could only think of a single dish I fully remembered.<br /><br />

No disrespect to the restaurant of course. Both times I waddled out of there very pleased with myself. But the egg dashi broth, dish twelve out of thirteen, was the only one that's survived in the mind. The rest is a collection of accessories - crisp interior design, beautiful plates to compliment the foods, slick staff that operated to the highest degree. And a hefty price tag.<br /><br />

To twist the knife some more, I also have a framed copy of the menu from one of the visits. It's entirely in Hiragana and Kanji, and I still can't read half of it. Stunning.<br /><br />

Chef Miyazaki repurposed Ichigo Ichie almost two years ago, into a bistro restaurant that carried almost none of the ostentation, a clean and simple menu that still delivered, and the financial barriers to entry torn down. I imagine he's quite happier with this setup.<br /><br />

The level of artistic faff in The Menu is stupendous. Chef Slowik presents the first few courses with the camera framing him as some sort of religious prophet, even as the proceeding courses aim to push the clientele into seeing through the bullshit. His soft voice delivers the most venomous of lines with absolute beauty. He convinces you the viewer with ease that this is all beyond your comprehension, an act of culinary brilliance even as the counter-evidence sits directly in front of you: a pitiful shard of fish sitting atop some jaunty rocks. Or some broken emulsion.<br /><br />

It's put me on notice. Whatever about occasional restaurant visits, my own cooking was going to lean down this path if I didn't stop myself. Not to the same extent maybe, but definitely losing that touch of love that carries everything.<br /><br />

I cooked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-9EWcxtPPY">Lu Ruo Fan</a> for some friends that evening. Partly because it was a hearty-ish meal and I love doing that shit in big batches. Partially because it was from one of the cuisines I think I most enjoy<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[2]</a></sup>. And partially cos I thought it would impress people.<br /><br />

Maybe it did, but that should be a secondary thought at best. There's a vague gap between doing something new and cool to have fun exploring cuisines, and doing it to fuel the ego. The latter doesn't last, and it's hard to figure out when you're in the middle of this dance.<br /><br />

I'm certainly not too far gone yet. I think I can cook better than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s597UDb8qkE">Tyler's Bullshit</a>, and haven't said anything to put myself on Chef Slowik's execution list<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[3]</a></sup>. But maybe I should ease off on watching videos on Michelin-starred New York chefs preparing Korean barbeque.<br /><br />

I had more thoughts on The Menu, but they've slid from the mind since I started typing. Much like the clients, it doesn't entirely hold up to intense scrutiny. But the message is clear: cook for love.<br /><br />

Movie nights are going to be a regular thing at my place now. I'm thinking cheeseburgers next week.<br /><br />

Yu-Gi-Oh: Forbidden Memories is the stupidest most broken appallingly imbalanced piece of shit video game ever created. I love it to bits.<br /><br />

Released in Japan in 1999, and elsewhere in 2002, this game ruined several years of my childhood as I spent countless hours trying to beat it. I never did, and have no desire to try again. Skill will only bring you so far - you require hours of grinding to get top-tier cards, in-depth game exploitation knowledge, and the most absurd run of RNG imagineable.<br /><br />

The gameplay attempts to track the Yu-Gi-Oh card game, with one slight flaw: development of Forbidden Memories began before the card game was released. So the devs had some knowledge of the cards that would come out, basic mechanics in terms of monsters/spells/traps, life points, etc. But everything else, Forbidden Memories just kind of... made up.<br /><br />

<p>
<ul>
    <li>You can only play one card onto the field each turn, and it must be before you interact with the field</li>
    <li>It introduces a monster Star Sign system to create weaknesses/strengths versus other Star Signs, which simply does not exist outside of this game</li>
    <li>Monster effects do not exist</li>
    <li>Most of the game takes place in ancient Egypt rather than with the actual Yu-Gi-Oh cast. I find this quite charming but kid me was not impressed</li> 
    <li>Trap cards will automatically activate at the earliest legal moment, whether you or the opponent wants it or not</li>
    <li> Each monster card - and there are hundreds of them - have individually crafted 3d models, specifically for battle animations that most players will never see because you have to press a different button to see the 3d battle format, and the game never tells you this</li> 
    <li>Ritual cards do exist, however they're disgustingly bad to the point of it being endearing. You have to sacrifice 2-3 specific monsters to obtain the ritual monster, except THE GAME NEVER TELLS YOU WHICH MONSTERS TO SACRIFICE. AND THE MONSTERS HAVE TO BE ON THE FIELD IN ORDER TO BE SACRIFICED, IN A GAME WHERE YOU CAN ONLY PLAY ONE CARD PER TURN WHAT THE FUCK</li>
    <li>The fusion system hahaha holy shit</li><br /><br />
</ul>

Beating an opponent gives you a reward card, which operates off an absurdly opaque system where it judges how aggressive/tactical your gameplay was, and how quickly you ended the battle, then rates you as either "Power" or "Technical" and gives you a grade. The higher the grade, the better the card in that "Power" or "Technical" category. Good luck grinding S-rank Technicals.<br /><br />

Your reward for this, once you clear some huge power spikes, is a final boss gauntlet run of 6 opponents in a row. Each of these opponents has twenty cards in their card, rather than your five. They can see your hand at all times, as well as your face-down cards. Some of them (read: Seto) have cards that are so absurdly powerful that if they play multiple of them, there is absolutely nothing whatsoever you can do. You can board wipe sure, but that leaves you open to another 4500 ATK direct hit the next round. In a game with 8000 life points. And he has three of the stupid bastards.<br /><br />

There is absolutely no strategy that will save you if the game decides to screw you on RNG. Bad hand - dead. Opponent plays multiple Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragons DIRECTLY FROM THE HAND - dead. Game freezes at a very specific point because of a scratch in the disc - very dead. Last one might have been a me thing.<br /><br />

Did you think I wasn't going to elaborate on the fusion system? Well this is my blog and I do whatever I want, so enjoy:

<ul>
    <li>Cards are fused together in the hand without Polymerization</li>
    <li>The list of allowed fusions is manually coded in, with no tags in the code to specify which fusion material cards are beasts/machines/dark/male/female/whatever. <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/561010-yu-gi-oh-forbidden-memories/faqs/16613">Here is a quick summary of the fusions. It is insane.</a>
    <li>There are plenty of instances where fusing two monster will make one that is weaker in every single regard</li>
    <li>To copy a specific section I saw via a friend, here is some of the bizarre fusion rules coded in:
        <blockquote>[Female]<br />
        These are monsters that fuse with Stone Ogre Grotto to become Mystical Sand.<br />
        Notes:<br />
        - Performance of Sword, Spirit of the Harp and Spirit of the Winds are not
        female, even though they can be equipped with Cyber Shield and certainly look
        female.<br />
        - Mystical Sand, Empress Judge and Cosmo Queen can be
        considered female, as they can be equipped with Cyber Shield and look female,
        but they don't participate in any fusions as females because their attack level
        is too high.<br />
        - every female and every monster that can be equipped with Cyber Shield can be
        equipped with Electro-whip, but there are dozens of monsters that can be
        equipped with Electro-whip that aren't female and can't be equipped with
        Cyber Shield<br />
        - all females can be equipped with Malevolent Nuzzler<br />
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>Some other funny segments that I found:
        <blockquote>Note: every dragon can be equipped with Dragon Treasure, but there are 36 monsters that can be equipped with Dragon Treasure that are not dragons.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>[Bugrothian]<br />
                    These are monsters with strictly less than 1850 attack points that have primary type Aqua or first guardian star Neptune and that are not Fish with strictly less than 1600 attack points nor Sea Serpents.</blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>You can fuse spell and trap cards together what the fuck</li>

<p>
After my <a href="https://sandyspalace.ie/2025/08/11/WPlace-Shitposting-General.html">part 1 post</a> having initial fun with <a href="https://wplace.live/">WPlace</a>, I've been trying to branch out a bit more from painting and maintaining some existing pride flags.<br /><br />

I still keep an eye on the pride flags though. They get defaced pretty frequently, and there's a concerted push to paint pedophile flags on/around pride flags in an attempt to smear them. Much like real life, our existence is a constant battle on every front.<br /><br />

My online friend hasn't noticed the gay little message I left in her hometown. Don't wanna tell her outright, but the area is becoming increasingly busy and I don't wanna miss my chance either.<br /><br />

A friend of mine drew her custom Pokemon trainer which I thought was super cool. It was modelled off Kris and the Youngster from Pokemon Crystal, and comes off really well in WPlace. A lovely combination of cute art and a personal touch. I'm doing similar in that I'm drawing pixel art of my favourite Pokemon, but rather a dream team combination of my 6 favourites, complete with my favourite trainer design - Rosa, unsurprisingly. Really pleased with how this turned out.<br /><br />

I'm probably a bit burnt out after that one. I'll probably wind down my activities, as long as my city doesn't fall to 4Chan raids. What year is it, anyway?

<p>
<a href="https://sandyspalace.ie/2025/03/09/Say-Hi-To-Takumi-The-Toyota-GT86.html">Takumi</a> was bought 6 months ago, integrated into Ireland with wallet-annihilating speed, and has been enjoying his new life (hopefully).<br /><br />

He grabs loads of attention still. The car scene in Ireland is dire. It's not just that nice cars are expensive - <i>everything</i> is expensive. So a modded GT86 is more of a head-turner than it has any right to be. This wouldn't even be worthy of a sniff in Britain.<br /><br />

The previous owner - a delight of a woman from everything I've heard - has covered most of the basics of modding. Aero kit is in good shape, Invidia N1 exhaust looks like the correct call, and the decals are cool without being over the top. With the engine at 100,000 miles, I don't want to strain it more than necessary, and probably won't try to push more power out of it. A supercharger sounds fun, as long as I could keep it switched off 95% of the time. And where's the fun in that?<br /><br />

The ride leans on the stiff side. Which is to be expected, but roads in Cork are an incredibly accurate simulation of the moon after cluster bomb strikes. So this is my main area of focus. Fully adjustable suspension, in particular being able to adjust spring stiffness, would be amazing. This is a €1,000+ job though. Gotta sort out other life stuff before this.<br /><br />

Tyres are good, as Michelin Pilot Sport 5's would be, apart from the bit where Sandy uses them to sharpen his claws. No I don't plan on doing anything about this.<br /><br />

I've scratched the wheels a few times which is frustrating, especially as the base paint underneath is orange and looks terrible when exposed. Parallel parking is very prominent where I live, so this may continue to be an issue.<br /><br />

Fuel consumption is pretty poor in-town, which annoyingly is where most of my driving is located. I haven't let Takumi stretch his legs as much as he'd like. Even when good roads do exist, they're populated by tractors, campervans, and old people who got their license in 1968 down the bottom of a cereal box. I may end up just taking a ferry to Wales. Or France maybe. Particularly if I learn how to solo camp...<br /><br />

Getting the approval of bikers is my big thing. I got some revs of approval from a Kawasaki rider a few weeks back and am still glowing from that. Also got an earful of throttle from a modded Audi RS6, which considering that thing is a nuclear power plant on wheels, is a nice motivator! Plus the kids who ask me to rev it are still great.<br /><br />

Unsure will I take it to Mondello Park, as I've already been there twice and might enjoy learning a new track this time. Anglesey in Wales is right next to Holyhead and looks gorgeous, so that's the next goal!<br /><br />

Edit: what the fuck do you mean the ferry is more expensive than the entire track day

Armored Core 6 arrived at an interesting time. Fans of a gritty corporate-war mech series found themselves rubbing shoulders with lesbians freshly giddy from watching Gundam: The Witch From Mercury. The partnership between these two factions has been... interesting.<br /><br />

In hindsight, the first trailer containing the words <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlSfr6Wa5sc">"wake the dog up"</a> was an obvious flag. Then 621 getting ordered around by "Handler" Walter, with a gruff voice born of gravel getting run through a blender, set people off like nothing else before it. Later in the game, it leans directly into mind control plot lines. I wonder if the writers knew how it would all be received. Or maybe they were finally let loose.<br /><br />

What's followed since AC6 melded all this together is a fresh fanfic genre of a lovely diverse range of people getting hurled into scenarios of control (physical and mental), brainwashing, petplay, delightfully unhealthy relationships, containing lots of trans girlies. All enshrouded by the cold heartless shell of a mech they've been forced into. <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Mechsploitation">Fascinating stuff, really.</a><br /><br />

Unfortunately the unhealthy relationship stuff doesn't sit well with me. So I've been thinking instead about the coolness of mechs, the appeal of having one's humanity augmented and/or stripped away, and how this interacts with other people.<br /><br />

I adore technology at its hardware heart: cold metal that simply does what it does, and nothing more. You know why a mechanical watch moves, how an engine performs, how a lightbulb glows. They know their place, and I love them for it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>.<br /><br />

Technology should not think, that's what we're here for. The second metal thinks it knows better than you, intentionally or not, is where it all falls apart. Whether it's software designed for a different purpose than what you want, malicious code, or just plain bad design, the roles begin to shift. Metal is power, not control - that's your job.<br /><br />

This clashes badly with most mech fiction. Normally the mech is a tool of control via another entity - a human controller or corporation maybe. But what if it's a symbol of individual power? I like how <a href="https://sandyspalace.ie/2025/05/26/Heaven-Will-Be-Mine.html">Heaven Will Be Mine</a> captures this. The Ship-Selves are first and foremost an extension of their pilots, beyond even their physical forms. They live and fight on a tier of existence that humans could only dream of. They merely exist in ways never before possible.<br /><br />

The human element must reign supreme and free. Even when enshrouded in metal, even with orders being barked into their ear, even with the elements trying to wipe them out.<br /><br />

"I bet you're thinking of an F1 clip-" you're damn right I am. Behold the final five laps of the 2021 Russian Grand Prix from Max Verstappen's perspective. If you're expecting something dramatic, it doesn't happen. Max's engineer, Gianpiero Lambiase, is on top of every event before it's in front of his pilot's eyes. He makes the perfectly-timed call to switch to wet weather tyres on a track that's half dry, half soaked, and getting more volatile every lap. Gianpiero, with the crispest of voices, gives Max every bit of information he needs, and not a thing more, knowing with full confidence that Max can sweep aside everything in his way.<br /><br />

(The below embed likely won't work without watching it on youtube, still trying to figure out fixes to this)<br /><br />

Max makes it look easy, and carves up other elite pilots for breakfast. What powers it all is the confidence in every word said between them: no second-guessing, no doubt as to the thought put into them. The human element is simultaneously drowned out by mechanical whines, and the most powerful thing there is.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup><br /><br />

Outside of still-niche VNs, this concept doesn't seem to have much sway with the masses. Yet the concept of trust and love conquering all is a huge undeniable trope, I'm just applying it to massive hunks of metal that can crush your enemies. Y'know, normal kink stuff.

If you're not familiar, <a href="https://wplace.live/">WPlace</a> is a collaborative pixel art canvas of sorts, utilising OpenStreetMap and MapLibre for a rather joyful 2025 internet experience. Alternatively, it's the hottest place to shitpost right now.<br /><br />

The servers work approx. 4% of the time, which is charming for now. This will tire out a lot of the freshly enthusiastic crowd that have joined recently, but I'm sure scaling up the servers would be stupidly expensive for such a silly little (affectionate) site.<br /><br />

It is reminiscent of many more delightful websites that no longer exist. Existing not for profit, just for fun. Seeing your home city lit up with flags, artwork, and love is quite touching.<br /><br />

I've been painting, cleaning, and maintaining pride flags in my home city, helping a friend paint her cool custom Pokemon trainer sprite, creating a big sign that tells everyone where my cats live, and planting a little surprise for my online friend in her hometown (Hi Brigid &lt;3).<br /><br />

Though it does expose the fact that art and creativity have never been my strong suit. For every living second in school, my mind would lock up when given any open-plan "write/draw whatever you like" task, then I'd inevitably get shouted at for it. This builds up into me clutching to certainty and security a little bit too much. An open canvas is still scary in a sense.<br /><br />

As much as I like painting big trans-coloured love hearts where my friends might find them, something a bit more individual might be neat. I briefly toyed with sprite creators and assist tools before hitting another creative wall that I've never figured out how to break through. This also ties into creativitiy issues when it comes to this site, and my life and hobbies in general.<br /><br />

Much like relearning Irish, some kind of fundamental restart is needed.
