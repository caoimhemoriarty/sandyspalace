I've been free for 1086 days. There's nothing particularly special about the round numbers, nor the annual anniversaries. It was simply nice to realise.<br /><br />

"Free" is relative. I was worse off for many of those early days. But overall it's been a lovely time period to reflect on.<br /><br />

Sandy has been in my life for 1038 days. He has been a wonderful little tether of motivation.<br /><br />

I've had a stable roof over my head for 656 days. Acutely conscious of how fortunately the cards played out on this one. Many of us weren't that lucky. But whatever hand I had to play in it, I'm happy with.<br /><br />

I've been on HRT for 652 days. By far the most influential act of my life, and also one of the best. Still in the early game with this one :3<br /><br />

591 days since my first piercing. I left the shop already giddy for the next one. 340 days since my most recent ones. The cuntiness is still a work in progress but I grow happier and happier with it.<br /><br />

488 days since my first laser appointment. Still stings a bit. Worth it.<br /><br />

477 days since I had my moment of realisation that professional wrestling was the biggest dumbest shit ever and I loved it. Just felt nice to put something silly on this list. There's a specific story I can tell another time.<br /><br />

224 days since an intense awakening of mine. This is a public site and I will say no more. Teehee.<br /><br />

117 days since I called a long-distance friend of mine for the first time. We yapped about fashion, surgeries, cuddles, and bread.<br /><br />

34 days of legally being Caoimhe.<br /><br />

I've been in a safer place for 1086 days. At the same time, more vulnerable, excited, timid, loving, fearful, enthusiastic, rattled, motivated. Everything is more intense now. There is too much to do, and too many people to cling onto for dear life. But this will always beat a black hole and a dead end.

I swear I was ahead of the curve on this one. But modern technology has run out of usefulness to me.<br /><br />

It was obvious enough with the kind of blog I run. Sandy's Palace is HTML and CSS only (apart from 2 lines but don't worry about it), a haphazardly-run shambling mass of a thing. I adore it because it's mine, and I made it mine.<br /><br />

Virtually no aspect of modern tech allows this any more. Smartphones are walled gardens, hemming you in with the power of convenience, sleekness, and obfuscation. If you're on Android, you can fight back, but you need to Know in order to even begin. If you're on iPhone, forget it.<br /><br />

Every item that can be enshittified is in the process of being turned into an appliance. Something designed to break whenever it feels like, totally unrepairable, leaving you powerless to take ownership and control.<br /><br /> 

Modern cars disgust me. I don't consider them appealing at any price bracket. Frankly the more high-end you go, the worse it gets. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/everything-we-learned-from-a-week-with-apple-carplay-ultra/">Apple CarPlay takes greater priority on a new Aston Martin than anything else it determines on the fly.</a> A surprising aspect of conspicuous consumption to me was that people will happily pay for an appliance that is shit at what it does, as it displays the user's affluence even more effectively, not even needing their pricey toy to work. Also see: Cybertruck.<br /><br />

I made the leap to digital banks and briefly enjoyed it. Then they added a tab for investments. Then for crypto. Then popups for savings goals, trending tickers, brand discounts, analytics, RevPoints, 'Benefits', premium tiers... Trade Republic doesn't even let me see cashback accumulation any more.<br /><br />

Complaining stops here. I try to only bitch when I can do something about it.<br /><br />

Cars - no buying anything that contains the word 'infotainment'. If there's a head unit, ensure it's isolated from the rest of the car. Then replace said head unit with your own CIA-backed puppet. Mechanical switches only for everything important: car controls, air conditioning, cruise control, and ideally the handbrake. Mechanical tach and speedometer is a must.<br /><br />

Banks - It's time to Retvrn to your local credit union. Unlike AIB, BOI, PTSB, etc, these guys bail <i>you</i> out.<br /><br />

Every home appliance must be fixable with a hammer and/or a blowtorch. No exceptions.<br /><br />

Once the banal stuff is out of the way, how do we enjoy ourselves?<br /><br />

Digital photography still has plenty of skill curve left for me to climb, but it doesn't feel fruitful any more. Once you hit a certain level of playing with settings on a screen, it all feels academic. The thought of approaching the same hobby while being forced to relearn how everything works - now that's fun. I desperately want to jump into this with a silly little ‚Ç¨20 thing and actually fuck around and find out.<br /><br />

Cooking is unenshittifiable... right? Aside from online recipes. Make your own cookbook. And put chicken chasseur in there. You will thank me later.<br /><br />

I've never been good at arts and crafts, but if a cute girl taught me how to stitch and sew I'd be doing it all day everyday. Mostly to sew gay little patches onto things.<br /><br />

And saving all that, there's always domestic terrorism.<br /><br />

Another WhatsApp notification buzzes. It's the family group chat, for the tenth time this morning. I swipe it away as always, but refuse to mute it.<br /><br />

I check the password manager daily for logins that still use my deadname. Thirteen. Four relate to work and are therefore stuck for the medium-term. Seven relate to companies that are stubborn, backwards, or just plain broken. Two are last-gasp backups.<br /><br />

Ignore the ninty-three victories, and the stray five logins that are stuck on a different name of mine. The thirteen are the only ones on the mind.<br /><br />

Of course, it won't end once everything is converted. There's always something, or someone, that stands in our way, refusing to budge its worldview of us by an inch. A more wholesome way to approach this would be to embrace only that which accepts us, but alas I am a petty bitch.<br /><br />

There's a few enties that I wouldn't mention on a publicly viewable blog post, but if they prove troublesome I will drag them kicking and screaming into acknowledging our existence. It's been proven time and time again that this is the only reliable solution.<br /><br />

And then what? My brain can't settle for anything. There always has to be another hill to climb.<br /><br />

There's been some very nice moments recently that are brand new to me. Falling asleep with friends nearby, a view of Sandy and Muffin loafing observing their garden, the comfort of visiting a couple's place talking casual things for hours. A lot of it still does not feel real.<br /><br />

Maybe reinforcement of these lovely things is all that's needed. I don't need much more than what's already within reach.<br /><br />

Though I would enjoy breaking the Irish land speed record. 161mph is pathetic. But OTHER than that, I may just have to be content with being content.<br /><br />

I handwrote a letter today. It was burned into ash, and will never meet another pair of eyes.<br /><br />

The words were in my head for a few years. Mostly formless. Only in the last twelve months did I even begin to believe they were worth legitimising.<br /><br />

It took a lot of external pushes, often accidental ones. I would see another depiction of me, in another lifeform or entity or piece of media, and see myself as I feared I might.<br /><br />

A friend talked to me recently about allostatic load, the concept of repeated wear and tear on the mind and body causing it to fall apart. Initially we thought it related to rocks and I figured it was a very cool metaphor. I loved the thought of a rock still cracking despite the environment around it reducing its pressure and weight, likening that to the experience of having to fall down and become worse before we could get better. Unfortunately I could not find any rocks that behave like this, and allostasis is entirely a physiological thing. Still cool though.<br /><br />

I had seen myself as I had most feared, and knew it was part of me. I felt the thoughts in my mind, and knew they had been restless with nowhere to go for so long. In my case, I wrote them down, forcing myself to believe every word of it. In better circumstances, you may benefit from a different approach.<br /><br />

I may write them down again, with better phrasing, better examples of what I experienced, or better knowledge going into it. But it doesn't feel as necessary as the first time.<br /><br />

Our thoughts are very real. They are worth doing something about. Put them on a sheet of paper, then send it, burn it, or frame it on the wall. Say them to someone who matters. Type them into a letter, or make them into an art piece. But never in your life should you deserve to let them feed on you.<br /><br />

And, just as importantly, never again.<br /><br />

<p>
Lain met me at a strange time in my life. This is always the case for newcomers, as long as she finds you and not the other way around.<br /><br />

Serial Experiments Lain is a cultural icon for good reason. It becomes increasingly a horror piece the more fragmented our online personas become, the more they bleed into the real world, and the less that all of this feels unusual. I don't think it was entirely a deliberate choice from the creators, which makes it all the more interesting. <br /><br />

I'm not going to bother describing the plot or its metaphors. There's hundreds of YouTube videos and online articles that can do that far better than I could. There's a few elements of the show that have stuck themselves into my brain far more than the over-memed one-liners, or the aesthetic vibe pics of Lain that have since gained a life of their own.<br /><br />. 

This show adores the use of silence. It permeates everything. There more you hide from your own thoughts, the worse this sensation picks at you. Lain happily takes advantage of this, throwing overly bright lights at you, or otherwise just uncomfortable situations. The more your ears search for a distraction, the more they pick up a faint buzzing, that infiltrates almost every scene of this show. The Wired, both physical cables and metaphysical thoughts, is always with you.<br /><br />

You cannot escape the phone in your pocket. Not since it became the only way you could hear from your friend. How would you find them otherwise?<br /><br />

Lain's descent into silence should instil fear in you. It's born out of discomfort with herself, that she can only exist as her true self in the Wired. You can do everything there, and nothing here. When the Wired begins to mesh with reality, Lain finds herself phasing out, watching her digital self take over, watching in muted terror as the fake-smile Lain walks away with her life.<br /><br />

I've felt it myself, when the digital me can say things that physical me can't. When either form can't manage it, it's a different kind of dread. Either serves the same purpose, pushing you away from others and into a blank space where you topple at the slightest push.<br /><br />

It might be a strange comparison, but I like to think of this section in a similar vein to what happens in Steins;Gate - a watershed moment that brings all your conceptions and mistakes crashing down upon you.<br /><br />

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tm-8HIOHlA">Here's the scene that brings all of these thoughts together.</a> It still hurts to watch, and probably always will.<br /><br />

In Lain's case, with everything else lost, what keeps her final shred of sanity intact is connection. Her love with Alice is one of my favourites in media because of how simple it is. I see it in my friendships, my partnerships. A fragile touch of contact is enough to keep Lain real, even at her worst. The tiniest touch, even in silence, means the world to me.<br /><br />

There are multiple Alices in my life and in yours. We are nothing without them.<br /><br />

I don't really have any closing thoughts. The above has been a jumble in my mind that only became clearer once I was able to push my life forward. It will likely mean something different to me in the future. In a still-novel joy, I look forward to it.<br /><br />

<p>
    Signalis is stupendously well-reviewed. I'm less convinced, and am writing halfway thoughts on the knowledge there's a 50% chance I won't see the finish.<br /><br />

    Aesthetically born from the era of CRT televisions, analogue error codes, and fifth-generation video game consoles. Narratively created via H.P. Lovecraft, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and plenty more I didn't pick up on.<br /><br />
    
    Visually you will feel very at home here if you're familiar with analogue horror. PS1-era graphics and icons help this along, to the extent that you can see the direct inspiration from specific games - Metal Gear Solid comes to mind for some of the more subtle instances.<br /><br />

    Sound design is quite neat. I'm a big fan of the subtle touch, and there's enough audio cues to nudge the player into uncertainty without coming off as in-your-face.<br /><br />

    Mechanics is where the game falls down quite hard. It pulls far too enthusiastically from the old Resident Evil games - you get a key that forces you to backtack two levels, which lets you unlock a safe that gives you a key, which makes you traverse one floor in order to open a door leading to a desk that contains a key, which opens a lift on a different floor that leads to... another key. Utterly obnoxious.<br /><br />

    Heavily limiting the player's inventory would be fine, except for the occasional room contiaining 2-3 key items, forcing you to backtrack multiple floors to the single storage point available to you.<br /><br />

    Puzzles are fine, combat is fine, but the above drags the game to a state where I simply don't care to carry on. The plot is working towards something interesting, but the interest simply isn't there any more. There's nothing wrong with a slightly shorter game.

    An instant community in a box! How could I say no?<br /><br />
    
    <a href="https://bloodontheclocktower.com/">Blood on the Clocktower</a> is a social deducation game best played in the shaded section of a comfy bar that runs board game nights. I was already suffering from the heat of the upstairs section and the timing was impeccable.<br /><br />

    We had a party of 18, which seemed unmanageable but for the excellent gamemaster who somehow kept on top of every piece of intrigue, truth, lie, and shittalk that was happening. 14 townsfolk, 4 outsiders. I chose outsider due to its handy ability of not tying the player to the game for its entire duration - very handy for someone who likes to step out dramatically and without warning.<br /><br />

    Dennis talked me into playing the Gunslinger. A chaotic role that allowed me to rooty tooty point and shooty one person per night, as long as they voted to execute another player. My strategy for this role revolved around a few core thoughts:<br /><br />
    <ul>
        <li>I had no idea how the intricacies of the game would function</li>
        <li>Chaos is funny when done right</li>
        <li>I could sit back and observe other players, rather than jump straight into accusations that I didn't fully understand</li>
        <li>"???"</li>
        <li>I was sitting at the corner of the circle and can't comprehend shit in large spaces</li>
    </ul>
    Day 1, and another player zooms up to me as soon as the day phase began. He begged me to shoot him, claiming to be the Angel that absolutely should not be executed on pain of instant team failure. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f7Gh-EABf0">My mind may have been elsewhere during this very interesting conundrum.</a><br /><br />

    I shot him in the face on Night 1 or 2, can't remember which. Either way, he wasn't playing me, and I wouldn't have known otherwise if he was. Good start.<br /><br />

    Days 2 and 3 are where my masterplan come to fruition. At this point I have little clue what the fuck is going on, Matteo is devising a prosecution statement as long as the entire script of Fate/Stay Night, and there's growing confusion as to who has what roles. Unveiling my grand strategy of Shut The Fuck Up, I refuse to shoot anyone for two nights in a row. This has several key benefits:
    <ul>
        <li>Opting not to shoot someone suspected of being Good, AND someone suspected of being Evil, casts me out of this argument by confusing everyone involved</li>
        <li>Enhances my pretty and mysterious demeanour sitting in the corner teeheeheeing because I have no poker face</li>
        <li>Less is more (a good life strategy in general)</li>
    </ul>
    
    Day 4 proceeds, and the gamemaster nudges us along to speed things up. It's been about 90 minutes, and half the townsfolk are still alive. The discussion that night was lively, plenty of votes put forward on all sides, and there was a growing likelihood that our numbers will be thinned significantly by the next morning.<br /><br />

    Naturally, I take out my gun for the first time in over an hour, and shoot the demon in the face on first attempt. Ending the game in the silliest possible way, and a first according to the gamemaster in his 2-3 years of running it.<br /><br />

    This wouldn't be half as funny except for the fact that, out of the three players I was suspecting, I was wrong about all but one of them. And I picked my target randomly.<br /><br />
    
    Don't tell the other players though. I'm sure they won't find out.<br /><br />

    9/10 great game ye should try it

<h2><a href="https://defector.com/seven-days-at-the-bin-store">Seven Days At The Bin Store</a></h2>
<blockquote>Baltimore Avenue runs from the University of Pennsylvania campus in the east, west through a neighborhood that‚Äôs a mixture of million-dollar houses, squats-turned-group-houses, and some of the city‚Äôs most persistent poverty. For the six-ish years I‚Äôve lived here, I‚Äôve watched a handful of bougie businesses open and quickly fold, leaving behind empty storefronts. Housing prices just go up and up, but the retail strip suggests an uneven gentrification. Those fluctuating fortunes are mirrored in starkly divergent views of whether Amazing Binz is an ‚Äúamazing store with amazing stuff and amazing prices‚Äù (their first Google review) or ‚Äúa place that sells crap‚Äù (a post on West Willy).</blockquote>
A rather American take on the mesmerisingly vast world of fast commerce.<br /><br />

<h2><a href="https://www.comradegallery.com/journal/photo-essay-the-unworldly-photos-of-industrial-waste-pollution-landscapes-in-russia-environmental-policy">The Surreal Landscapes of Industrial Waste in Russia</a></h2>
<blockquote>Photographer Alexander Sukharev set out to document these hidden hazards. As a co-founder of the Kosmaj Project, he spent months traveling across the country, from Moscow to Vladivostok, using a drone to capture the scale of the damage. What began as a planned visit to a few sites soon became an obsession, leading him to seek out these polluted landscapes in nearly every city he passed.</blockquote>
More pictures than words, but still fascinating.<br /><br />

<h2><a href="https://www.danvk.org/2025/04/23/boggle-solved.html">After 20 Years, the Globally Optimal Boggle Board</a></h2>
<blockquote>Using a 192-core c4 on Google Cloud, it took about 5 days to check around 1 million 4x4 board classes (~23,000 CPU hours). This is about $1,200 of compute. That‚Äôs a lot, but it‚Äôs not a crazy amount. (Fortunately I had a friend in BigTech with CPUs to spare.)<br /><br />

The result was a list of all the Boggle boards (up to symmetry) that score 3500+ points using the ENABLE2K word list. There were 32 of them. Here are the top five:<br />
<ul>
    <li>plsteaiertnrsges (3625 points)</li>
    <li>splseaiertnrsges (3603 points)</li>
    <li>gntseaieplrdsees (3593 points)</li>
    <li>dresenilstapares (3591 points)</li>
    <li>dplcseainrtngies (3591 points)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

Also I learned a few weeks ago that my family have been using house rules for Boggle for 20 years and I never knew. We were running a restriction of much longer character requirements per word, but the letters didn't need to be in adjacency to each other. Frankly I prefer this because I beat everyone in this variant :3<br /><br />

(On some occasions, it will mention Reddit or Wikipedia.) On the right side of the screen, Google provides a little box with three sites linked, which you can expand to see more options. To the end user, it's utterly unclear if those are "sources," "recommendations," or "partner deals."<br /><br />

Perhaps more surprisingly, in our testing, not a single AI Mode "sites box" listed a site that ranked on the first page for the same query on a regular search. That is, the links in AI Mode for "best foods to eat for a cold" don't overlap at all with the SERP for the same query in Google Search.

    Muffin is a stupid little bastard boy with nothing in between his ears but chaos. He is dearly beloved and I will raze towns to the ground for his entertainment.<br /><br />

    Like Sandy, he's a rescue cat from North Kerry. We suspect they're cousins: their family tree more closely resembles a hedge. He was rescued along with his sister Nova, who happily subjugated Muffin during their weeks together.<br /><br />

    Until 8 weeks old he stayed with my friends who rescued him, fawned over by 2-3 dogs, attacked on the regular by 2 cats, and ignored by the other cat. A well-balanced upbringing to ensure that he'd want to burn everything to the ground in the future.<br /><br />

    <figure style="margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">

    </figure>

    To give him credit, he was an incredibly fun kitty who was full of beans 100% of the time, as he should be. Permanently wide-eyed and attacked everything on sight. Especially feet. <br /><br />
    
    Sandy never took to him as well as Chili though. The lack of playfighting really was telling. Even now, he's never really bonded with him particularly well. They do hang out and look after each other a bit though which is nice.<br /><br />

    One of his best qualities is his responsiveness. He will adapt to everything you say and do, and he's super clear on what he's feeling (hint: there's two brain cells and only one isn't thinking about food). His tail is basically a mobile exclamation mark. <br /><br />

    <figure style="margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">

    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">&gt;:3</figcaption>
    </figure>

    Around 6 months old, the energy wasn't abating in the slightest. At this point we realised we had a problem on our hands. Muffin was a 24/7 terminator, eternally aiming to kill flies, toes, bits of dust in the air, his own tail, any type of reflection, swaying grass, still shadows, dry food, sparks that came out of the fireplace...<br /><br />

    This all came to a head when he was around 9 months old. He was at his holiday home (ie. my parents') in Kerry for a weekend. We're all chilling in the sitting room, when he comes thundering in using only three legs. He put absolutely no weight on it, and would launch away from us if we approached. The last time this happened, a kitty x-ray revealed it was only a sprain, but this time it looked far worse.<br /><br />

    </figure>

    A week later, the vet had confirmed that Stupid Bastard Idiot Boy had broken his tibia in three places. Most likely from jumping from too high a height, a sin he had committed before and learned nothing from.<br /><br />

    After a few days in the vets and a small fee of ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EURO YOU FLUFFY DIPSHIT, Muffin returned to us with an array of splints on his leg, much less fur than before, and a shame cone he refused to wear for more than two seconds. The vet condemned him to four weeks in a cage, with a further two weeks indoors, before he could go outside again. Hell ensued.<br /><br />

    <figure style="margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">

    </figure>

    Muffin may have returned to the outdoors a little sooner than 6 weeks. I may have murdered him otherwise.<br /><br />

    After his recovery, he's become even more of a demon tyrant. He has found and executed a local resistance band of mice/voles, and has since turned his attention to the murder of fat birds. The line had been overstepped when he caught and released a garden bird into the house, then proceeded to de-feather the poor bastard. He's more of an indoor boy now.<br /><br />

    Muffin had his first birthday very recently. I have no idea how many more he'll live at this rate, but he finds a way of thriving even when everyone is desperate to stop him. Frankly it makes him worse :3

    Sandy is the oldest soul in a fluffy young vessel, living a life that I could only dream of. Also a bit of a weirdo. My weirdo.<br /><br />

    He was rescued in North Kerry, his mother having been run over by a car and 4 of his siblings being lost in the days following. Extracted at only 1-2 weeks old, he was nyoomed alongside his brother Astra to Cork, where he's been thrown straight into a life of being fawned over ever since.<br /><br />

    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">Big Sandy doesn't want you to know this, but</figcaption>
    </figure>

    In hindsight, he was split up from Astra too early, at 6-8 weeks old. His rescuer had decided I badly needed some company in my then-current state, and he was probably right.<br /><br />

    Sandy spent his first 6 months with me in a tiny flat, plus a tiny concrete square about 1m¬≤ being the closest thing either of us had to a garden. He would spend about 16 hours a day napping on a little window bed I had mounted to some glass facing the main road, then when he couldn't take any more naps, he'd thump down to the ground and trot up to me squawking for attention. It was a nice little routine no matter how small it was.<br /><br />

    There's a picture of me that will never see the light of day. I'm in bed looking like absolute shit, to the extent that I'm almost unrecognisable to myself now. Sandy is lying on my chest, face smushed up against my chin, paw wrapped around my shoulder. He did that every morning when I couldn't get out of bed. I think about it a lot. If I ever got the chance to ask him about it, he'd probably just brush it off and claim he had nothing better to do, but I know the truth :3<br /><br />

    I would attempt to bring him on little car drives for enrichment, and some ill-advised walks on a lead around business parks at night where I almost lost him. It was enough to keep him reasonably entertained for a while, but he needed more.<br /><br />

    When I was dating my then-partner, I would occasionally try to bring Sandy over to meet her kitties on a cat date of sorts. He hated them beyond belief.<br /><br />

    We went on frequent weekend trips to my family, and he hated the cage so much that I let him wrap around my neck in the driver's seat. Would not recommend, but it was very funny for the year that I did it.<br /><br />

    I got my second cat<a href="https://sandyspalace.ie/2025/05/25/Chili.html">Chili</a> as a treat for Sandy, and also some extra motivation for me to keep pushing and get them a better home. The two of them adored each other, and quickly outgrew that tiny place. He's never been the same after she left.<br /><br />

    </figure>
    </video>

    I moved into my new home for them first and foremost. I didn't really need a garden otherwise. Thankfully they loved it, and even forgave me for the stress of moving... in time.<br /><br />

    Sandy has been, with no exeption on any day, a fluffy little delight. Very strange though. He's easily spooked, and seems constantly low-key stressed. He strikes me as the type of cat we could lose to the silliest little thing, even as cautious as he normally is.<br /><br />

    </figure>

    What's great is his very clear preferences: the precise positioning of his food bowl, the need for a constant supply of dry food and special top-ups of wet, a constant desire for two Chilling Spots that he can move between at will, and his loving of antisocial loafing. Extremely autistic even as cats go.<br /><br />

    He will be three years old this summer, and he already acts like he's thirty. Fluffy bastard took one look at me in 2022 and decided on an early retirement &lt;3<br /><br />
