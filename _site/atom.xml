  <p>
    At time of writing, this site has a basic home page, navbar, Blog Archive, and About page all typed up.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's been created via <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> as a static site generator, and the theme is a lightly modified version of <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/dark-poole/">Dark Poole</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hosting is done by my own dedicated server, which also hosts a few other fun purposes. TLS certificates are done by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>, and domain management by <a href="https://www.blacknight.com/">Blacknight</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the site is in its simplest possible form, and before I start overcomplicating things, there's a few improvements to be made:
      <ul>
        <li>Get an 88x31 button created<s>, and new favicon icon</s></li>
        <li>Expand the home page to have a few more links to projects</li>
        <li>Create a basic webring</li>
        <li><s>Create a deploy script to automate the actions of Jekyll building, testing nginx, then reloading nginx via systemctl</s></li>
        <li><s>Build an easy and reliable way of editing/creating from my various machines. Currently I'm using Putty to SSH into the server, then using Nano to create and edit files... it's not fantastic</s>Put VS Code onto my main machine, it's alright, Putty does the job for the simple work, couldn't be arsed doing anything grander than that</li>
        <li><s>Link in the subdomain for the seedbox, for no reason other than showing off</s></li>
        <li><s>Add an icon of a little cat paw when hovering over the navbar :3</s> Already close to giving up on this one, it's a pain in the ass that I don't fully understand yet</li>
      </ul>
