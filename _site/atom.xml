<p><h1>Serious Reads</h1></p>

<h2>The first prototype of the MingKwai Chinese typewriter has been rediscovered</h2>

Spread across three links below, this is the story of the MingKwai, a revolutionary typewriter that was radically ahead of its time.<br /><br />

<a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/05/mingkwai-chinese-typewriter-prototype-stanford-libraries">Here is the article talking about how the first ever prototype model has just been found:</a>

<blockquote>Lin invented a machine that altered the very act of mechanical inscription by transforming inscription into a process of searching,” Mullaney said. “The MingKwai Chinese typewriter combined ‘search’ and ‘writing’ for arguably the first time in history.</blockquote><br />

Next up, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVPFU3TK9fU">a video of the prototype itself.</a><br /><br />

Third, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNoWMaOyWHY">an in-depth video explaining how it functions.</a>The machine translation of this video is pretty solid, but even just the video has some useful animations to explain how the typewriter's search mechanics work.<br />

<h2><a href="https://medium.com/@brentcsutoras/the-em-dash-dilemma-how-a-punctuation-mark-became-ais-stubborn-signature-684fbcc9f559">The Em Dash Dilemma: How a Punctuation Mark Became AI’s Stubborn Signature</a></h2>

<blockquote>And now? Humans are ditching em dashes, not because they don’t like them, but because they’re terrified their writing will look fake. One commenter on Hacker News even called it out directly, saying ‘the em dash is now a GPT-ism and is not advisable unless you want people to think your writing is the output of a LLM.</blockquote><br />

Not 100% accurate on the finer details of how LLMs are constructed, but ultimately the ripple effect is real.<br />

<h2><a href="https://oxfordamerican.org/oa-now/the-alabama-landline-that-keeps-ringing">The Alabama Landline That Keeps Ringing</a></h2>

<blockquote>About 13 million people in the US and 2.6 billion people globally don’t use the internet, whether for reasons of availability, desire, cost, or religion. Some may have it but don’t feel confident using it. To their callers, who dial from all over the world, these students are the internet. And lucky for callers, these students are remarkably non-judgmental when it comes to the questions they’re asked.</blockquote>

<p><h1>Light Reads</h1></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV36QPB0pew">A bizarre Evangelion Horse Racing advertisement from the 1990s</a></h2>
Neon Genesis Evangelion if it made far more sense.

<h2><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ldnedvde9o">Case quacked: Flying duck caught by Swiss speed camera is repeat offender</a></h2>
Partially here for the funny title, and mostly because it's just funny.<br /><br />

And finally, because it makes me laugh every single time I think about it. Every time you wonder if you're just pretending, that you're not enough, that you don't deserve success, just remember: the Ferrari Formula 1 team continues to pay its radio engineers 6-digit figures.<br /><br />

<div>
<blockquote>We love these places anyway. They're becoming more and more like home. All we need are more of us.<br /><br />And they come, descending in waves, trying to take us back. We beat them back every time, and sometimes one or two look around, and decide "I'd rather stay here." And then there's more of us.<br /><br />Sometimes they succeed, and take one of us back home. That's just as fine with us. We should go where we wish, live as we wish, and if our sisters get taken home, they bring a small part of us back to the Earth. That can't go unchanged.</blockquote><br />

My brain has been fundamentally rewired again. It happens on select occasions, when the right piece of media hits me at the right time, and I engage with it in the right mindset.<br /><br />

Heaven Will Be Mine is short and sweet. A full playthough is roughly five hours. Within that time, it packs a narrative of the trans struggle for identity and recognition, the search for meaning in a perpetually hostile world, the never-ending quest of humans' self-discovery and exploration, and of course cool mechs beating each other up.<br /><br />

Gameplay is delivered in the typical visual novel format, with choices along the way deciding your ultimate faction alignment, and what girls you get to make out with. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1579698535">Here's how to do that by the way.</a><br /><br />

You play across three main characters, each fulfilling various archetypes and personalities. Broadly, I enjoyed all three characters, but felt there was scope to expand and elaborate on their thoughts and feelings. Like the over-arching story itself, much is left up to the reader to decide.<br /><br />

Luna-Terra, the ace pilot, is the most "tired" of the three. Fighting through struggles without the self-respect to meaningfully change anything.<br /><br />

Pluto, a human that's gone beyond humanity. Absurdly powerful in her new form, but rejects the image of overwhelming strength that others assume of her.<br /><br />

And Saturn; unconventional, unpredictable, aggressively flirty. L33t h4xor extraordinaire.<br /><br />

I resonate strongly with Luna-Terra, and am looking respectfully at Saturn. Make of that what you will.<br /><br />

<blockquote> Through gravity, humans are ruled by each other. Anti-matter, anti-gravity, anti-culture; all exists as a resistive force to this gravity. The refusal of humanity to accept these parts of itself cause its own undoing. When we let our children develop in the lightness of space, they chose their bodies, genders, souls, hearts of their own volition. They became human in the ways they wished to become human.</blockquote><br />

The fight against Gravity is relentless. The pull of the Earth is not just measured in F = G(m1m2)/R2. It's measured in the mass of human history, the difficulty in breaking free of "normal", and the violence that follows resistance.<br /><br />

This was one of the most interesting metaphors in the game. In the context of gravity, one could choose stand on the surface of planet Earth, and cease resistance. Alternatively you could orbit the planet, still caught in its field, but with some measure of distance. To truly break free of it, how far would you need to go?<br /><br />

Creation of one's own gravity field, or connecting to a totally different one, can be seen as the liberation that these characters crave. I won't say more here, but the game does broach this in interesting ways.<br /><br />

<blockquote> In time, the shape conforms to the human inside. This in part confirms the specific theory: the human part isn't the ear, but the hole in the lobes for your earrings, lipstick is real, lips are not, and we see humanity defined in its gravitational output.</blockquote><br />

Ship-selves are another crucial aspect to this. They cannot survive on the surface of planet Earth. They are with form, but contort to replicate the user over time. Luna-Terra's is untouchable, Saturn's is bold and brave, Pluto's is warm and all-encompassing.<br /><br />

It is through Ship-selves that the pilots can fight against gravity, fight against each other, fight against the world. They are constructed in such an intricate way that they cannot kill another. There is a joy in it that cannot be found or replicated anywhere else, lonely as it may be.

<blockquote>No one should die in space. No one should die, period. No one has to die, because Ship-Self combat is shimmering missiles of light, cosmic explosions, electricity that sears through the soul. Blade sciences impossible for a human to produce! Dances of combat without end!<br />A fight against ideas with toys. Humans would never show that sort of compassion to each other.</blockquote>

The true capabilities of the Ship-selves are very ambiguous, more created as a tool of interpretation, as opposed to acting as the centrepiece of the VN.<br />

<p><blockquote>&gt;I worry about what we would be like if that hadn't happened. For me or for you. [...] Would it have taken us even longer? I already feel like I became a person too old. Would we spend our lives without ever-<br /><br />&gt;We'd have found another way. Somehow. In Earth or space, no one is ever born whole. We got there eventually, didn't we?<br /><br />&gt;Ha, I think so too. So I would like to believe that no matter what, we could live and be happy?<br />&gt;Even in mortal bodies, on our boring, awful home.<br />&gt;I mean, they can't undo what we have done.<br />&gt;When they take us back, they will have to make us a part of them.</blockquote></p>

There is pain and reassurance in seeing these thoughts said out loud. Just living can often be sufficient - both as an individual and in the cultures that we create.<br /><br />

You can interpret a relentless sadness from any of the situations put forward in HWBM. To live free of Earth's gravity means losing and sacrificing aspects of us, not because they are necessarily incompatible with us, but because the rest of humanity refuses to allow it to exist.<br /><br />

Yet there is joy in fighting for ourselves and each other, and this persists beyond the endless struggle.<br /><br />

        Today would have been my cat Chili's second birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
        She was found by a then-partner of mine, miles out of the city, barely able to walk. Her mother was nearby, but seemingly wasn't able to help her.
    </p>

        </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
        She had multiple infections, most predominantly in the eyes. It took weeks of treatment before she was able to see properly, and I suspect they never fully healed.
    </p>
    <p>
        She was a wild cat since birth, and acted like it. She was troublesome but clingy at the same time. Litter training her was the most difficult of any cat, as it was tough to dissuade her from going whenever she needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interestingly, the vet who performed her surgeries described her as "borderline intersex". During development, the positioning of body parts suggested it was anticipating male organs, but she got female ones instead. The vet described this using very helpful diagrams.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once she cleared the first few weeks, I introduced her to Sandy, my other idiot, who was roughly 1 year old at the time. They bonded faster than any other cats I've seen.

        </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
        Having two cats was a huge motivator for me to get a more stable roof over my head. The thought of letting down them was more worrying than the thought of disappointing myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the typical delays in buying and moving house, Chili was a year old by the time we finally moved. Outside of visits to the family home, she never had any real opportunity of exploring the outdoors in a safe way.

    </p>
    <p>
        One of my fondest memories of her is the day of moving - October 30th 2023. The two cats didn't know what to make of everything. The house smelled something bizarre, and they were totally unused to any new environment that wasn't friendly to them. Yet they ran their Sniffy Inspection Squad through every single room to keep me safe :3
    </p>

    <p>
        The house move was super difficult for many reasons. I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor, that I shifted between the two liveable rooms in the house, whenever I needed to work on the other. Chili would join me every night for the first few weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
        She also took time out to look after Sandy, who wasn't finding the move very enjoyable. On the first night, Sandy saw the miserable-looking mattress that I was hopping on top of, realised he wasn't going back to the flat, and did the closest thing to crying I've ever seen a cat do. Chili was on the case. 
    </p>

        </figure>
        </video>
    <p>
        She loved the outdoors, and took to the area like a natural. The back garden is removed from the local roads, and the area cats have no need to put themselves in danger unless they feel like it. Chili didn't wander much, but she loved the big pine tree my neighbour has.
    </p>
    <p>
        <figure style="margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">
        <img src="/assets/images/blog/chili-4.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;" />
        <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">They never did forgive me for cutting down the overgrown garden.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
        Chili thoroughly enjoyed her new lifestyle for the next 6 months. It was the ideal setup, two cats that looked after each other, barely fought, and gave each other space when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chili didn't return home one random night. I set up the usual for her: both dry and wet food indoors and outdoors, fresh water bowls, and put some used clothes in the garden to mark her home.
    </p>
    <p>
        She returned the following day, but something was off about her. Despite no visible injuries, she seemed unnerved, shook, or maybe just super curious about something I didn't understand. She ate food happily, but after that was bursting to leave again. She suddenly had no interest in the safe indoors, and only had eyes for whatever was on her mind outside.
    </p>
    <p>
        <figure style="margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">
        <img src="/assets/images/blog/chili-5.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;" />

        </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
        I kept her inside for three days, but it fixed nothing. Every time I even glanced at a window or door, she was there by my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually she did slip between my feet and escape. She was never a catchable cat, but I decided to trust her anyways. Whatever had caught her attention, I hoped that she'd take care of it and come back. Of course, she didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
        We never did find her. I still hope to this day that she popped into someone else's home, preferred the couch, and decided to stay. No other explanation makes sense or gives hope.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, happy birthday Chili. Your cat yoghurt is waiting for you in the fridge, same as last year.

        <blockquote>And I am reminded of this every day when I open the news. It is a hidden abuse that was done to me — and to all of us — that it is normal to live in this way. That to live in a country with liberty, we must give up our liberty to feel safe and supported. And we have been living in fear, I believe, for a long time. To my friends still living in the U.S. and who are afraid - consider this your validation. It is not normal for you to live like this. It was never normal to live like this.</blockquote>

Many of us may not. Absence of choice is hard to sense, and mechanization’s real innovation is in creating a complacent buyer with reduced expectations. Once you’ve done that, you can sell them whatever you want. What is being mechanized by AI is our tastes—our ability to discern quality (or originality) at all.</blockquote>

Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the “Mozzarella Phase” and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model.</blockquote>

        I know and love myself more than I ever did before. This has only been strengthened by this kind of self-searching that may never conclude. Far from a weakness that people trapped by normality and fear would have you or I think.

    <p>
        Frankly my main concern wasn't other people's perception. It was moreso the dread of what I'd already semi-completed before: The arduous process of changing hundreds of usernames and email logins. A password manager was absolutely mandatory, and frankly it's reinforced my horror of people who don't use one. Use Bitwarden today &#128591;

    </p>
    <p>
        The legal name change is further down the road, but the hard work has already been done. I've fought state departments, civil servants, and bureaucrats long enough to know that I'll feel no validation from their acknowledgement of my existence. If I were being more cynical, I'd say I was looking down the road of future hate, steeling myself for when the vague tolerance of me is stripped away. We will live far beyond that.

    <p>
        The pivotal moment here came much earlier in this process. A friend shuffled next to me in the pub, asking simply "Hey Caoimhe how's it going?" I spent a while stumbling to answer (normal), not immediately noticing the glint that was forming in her eye. "I just wanted to see your reaction when I called you that".
    </p>

        Hello did you know I have incredible taste and terrible spending habits :3
    </p>

    <p>
        <figure style="margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">
        <img src="/assets/images/blog/takumi1.jpg" alt="Description of the image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;" />
        <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">Excuse the editing, it's not my day job.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This is my new love, a Toyota GT86 imported from Britain. First-gen ZN6 model, with a decent modding and maintenance scene supporting it. It seems to have aged really well as a platform, with only the valve spring recall being a particularly notable problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's a classic old school 2+2, sacrificing raw power for reduced weight, low centre of gravity, and a setup that's incredibly driver-focused. I still haven't had a proper test of it on winding    country roads, but it's been super fun every chance I get to bring it around.
    </p>

    <p>
        I would dearly like to meet the previous owner. She's put on some rather interesting boy racer mods, but after almost 100,000 miles, there's barely a scratch on it, or heavy wear on the mechanicals. The front aero splitter, carbon side skirts, ducktail spoiler, and Invidia exhaust are all great looks and really elevate the machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        <figure style="margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">
        <img src="/assets/images/blog/takumi2.jpg" alt="Description of the image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;" />
        <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">Very useful for supermarket car parks yknow</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </p>

    <p>
        Performance-wise, there's a small improvement from the Invidia exhaust, but otherwise no power modifications. I'm curious to push the platform, but don't think I'll make any excessive changes. 220 HP (160KW) is honestly fine for Irish roads, as we don't have the wonderful country roads of America or Britain, or any continental European country for that matter. Too many fucking bumps. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Plus... it already has 100k miles on it. Pushing it beyond 300 HP is questionable at its current age.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's great to drive, which is the entire point of the car so that shouldn't come as a huge surprise. The steering is incredibly direct, and wonderfully hooked up at all speeds. Suspension is borderline too stiff for daily driving, particularly on the rear, but has great responsiveness.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Invidia exhaust adds a huge amount of depth to the noise, but honestly I love the whines from the engine, and wish I could hear them more. If it wasn't an economically terrible idea, a supercharger would be a fantastic addition if only for the audible aesthetics.
    </p>

    <p>
        <figure style="margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">
        <img src="/assets/images/blog/takumi3.jpg" alt="Description of the image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;" />
        <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">Mm yes very wise</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </p>

    <p>
        From a practical perspective, there's a bit too much drone when off-throttle. It's currently my biggest gripe, but not worthy yet of modifying the exhaust.
    </p>

    <p>
        I adore the reactions received. Kids will ask to hear some revs, and I love dishing it out. Only tonight a guy pulled up next to me, beaming and glowing with enthusiasm. I gave him a standing start procedure as thanks :D
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm planning its first track day, but might get adjustable coilover springs first. It would be super fun on track, and might also improve the bumpiness on the drive home afterwards.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally the one big sting... I paid as much in import costs as much as I paid for the car itself. The uprising against the Irish state has therefore been brought forward several weeks. 
    </p>

        Good news! I have acknowledged my hubris out loud, and am consolidating down to one server that's actually affordable and can handle all the current needs, plus keeping space for future requirements. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Took a while to get here mind you.
    </p>
    <p>
        I did have an interesting opportunity though. With three servers live at the same time, I tried to run some real-life benchmarks to see what was actually performing as expected.
    </p>
    <p>
        My first test was sending files directly from server to server using the scp command. I chose a single 1GB file, to reduce latency for different system handling of block allocation. The quality of the line connection is most important to me, I'm not bothered about CPU/RAM/HDD efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
        The file was an episode of Serial Experiments Lain, because I figured this is basically enrichment for Lain :3

        </tbody>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        Absolutely dire performance from OVH on both download and upload performance. The fact that these speeds are replicated in both directions, while pointing at different servers, who each performed well in separate tests, is incredibly damning. Leaseweb and Hetzner are pretty comparable and as advertised.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second experiment was just a network data sample of an average day's activity. I used vnstat to pull the daily upload total (in TB) for each server:
    </p>
    <p>

        <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Hetzner</th>
            <th>Leaseweb</th>
            <th>OVH</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
            <td>2025-02-23</td>
            <td>3.18</td>
            <td>2.51</td>
            <td>0.99</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        OVH is completely unsuitable for my needs, has speeds nowhere near advertised levels, and I've cancelled the service almost as soon as I ordered it.
    </p>
    <p>
        For choosing between Hetzner and Leaseweb, I still have concerns over the former's monitoring of torrents, given that the torrents it flagged on my IP address had seemingly nothing to do with my activity. However the peering is excellent, and there's a significant benefit in peer-to-peer file transfer rates. Server-to-server transfer rates are pretty much exactly the same as Leaseweb.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hetzner is therefore being prepped as the single server going forward, and Leaseweb will be used as a primary backup until its next renewal date. My home PC will be the future primary backup, which does suffer poor upload speed, but otherwise is safe and secure... and cheaper.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coincidentially, I had to wipe and restart Hetzner this week due to a setup error in the RAID 10 configuration, and was wasting 4TB of usable space in the root partition. This also gave me the opportunity to clean my my media library, assign a domain name to the media server (which subsequently makes transitioning to Jellyfin easier), fix some stupid nginx issues, and have the server running at peak efficiency. I'm extremely smug that, on maximum server utilisation, we only need 1.2GB RAM. Eat shit, Chrome.

        The more I try to scale my servers, the more issues I hit:
        <ul>
            <li>Leaseweb has poor peering, and Hetzner is hostile to Plex media servers and public torrent trackers</li>
            <li>I would rather move away from Plex and support an open-source alternative</li>
            <li>Storage is a continual issue. To achieve 10TB+ cloud storage requires increasingly high server costs, and the only affordable options are the ones with issues listed above</li>

    <p> 
        Currently the megatorrents take up 6.6TB, and I'm forecasting an increase of 1.2TB at the end of 2025. Some of these megatorrents are secondary, and don't require gigabit-line seeding support.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a secondary concern, the media server is currently 3.5TB in size. This could be alleviated by moving it to another network, or simply by scaling down the size of the library. Or by not downloading 4K but I'm not doing that :3
    </p>
    <p>
        Plus... price. I could keep paying higher and higher amounts for absurd storage and incredible connections, but we've passed the point where any of that benefits me. My charity work to the motorsports community has its limits.
    </p>
    <p>
        With this in mind, I'm on the hunt for a 6-8TB dedicated server, ideally with a gigabit line but I'd settle for 500Mpbs. To achieve this, some compromises need to be made:
        <ul>
            <li>The secondary-priority megatorrents need to be moved off the main server, maybe a week after they've been released to the general public</li>
            <li>The media server does need some degree of hosting on the server, as most of the media is obtained via private trackers. However I need to set up an automatic script that, once an item has hit its seeding ratio, it gets deleted from the server</li>
            <li>To achieve constrant streaming capabilities, I need a local media server rather than a remote one. The local server has a copy of all downloaded files, so once they're removed from the main server, there's no impact on streaming</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        There's one huge roadblock to the shuffling around of megatorrents and media files to local storage - local broadband. Even with a "gigabit" line, it's still residential, and therefore has dogshit upload speeds capped at 5MB/s.
    </p>
    <p>
        An opportunity arises from the fact that all of the primary megatorrents are updated in a narrow timeframe each year. Ideally all in the month of December. Additional space is required at this time, to allow me to host the old+new megatorrent for contingency reasons. But I could very feasibly rent a second server just for one month to alleviate this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enter my radical and brilliant and flawless new plan that will definitely last longer than a week:
        <ul>
            <li>Use my PC rig as the media server, running Jellyfin ideally, but Emby or Plex as a backup</li>
            <li>Rent a nice compact 8TB server for megatorrent hosting, plus media downloading + seeding</li>
            <li>Build a script to automate the handling of fully-seeded torrents</li> 
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        This requires the PC to be always-on, but it was always-on already :3
    </p>
    &lt;/p&gt;
        Today I'm sussing out some OVH servers, deciding between 500Mbps and 1Gbps, pulling the trigger, transferring everything over (again) and will report back when everything explodes
    &lt;/p&gt;

    <p>
        Did I need a new server? Absolutely not. So here we are.
    </p>
    <p>
        My existing Leaseweb server (provided via Hosting By Design) is a fairly capable machine:
        <ul>
            <li>CPU: Xeon E3-1230</li>
            <li>RAM: 32GB</li>
            <li>Storage: 4 x 8 TB HDDs, configured in a RAID 5 array</li>
            <li>Connection: Dedicated 1GBps line, 100TB monthly traffic cap</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        However I want to make a few improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, and most importantly, I'm fucking itchy and just love trying new shit out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Otherwise, I was eager to try different RAID configurations to see what could speed up my seedbox. Price wasn't a major concern, but I felt I wasn't utilising parts of my existing setup, mostly with the HDD configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hetzner and OVH were my main alternative choices, however I couldn't justify the cost of the OVH servers. They were too over-specced on non-HDD elements, which I don't need as much right now. Therefore I waited for a decent price on a Hetzner server auction, and snapped this up:
        <ul>
            <li>CPU: Xeon E3-1271</li>
            <li>RAM: 32GB</li>
            <li>Storage: 4 x 10 TB HDDs, configured in a RAID 10 array</li>
            <li>Connection: Dedicated 1GBps line, unlimited traffic cap</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Not exactly an earth-shattering change. The CPU upgrade isn't noteworthy. The monthly traffic cap likely won't exceed 50TB with my existing setup. So the major gains came from the RAID 10 configuration, which I am still exploring the optimisation side of.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here have been my adventures so far in getting it set up and replacing my old server:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Rescue system + Linux install:</b> Easy af, same as Leaseweb. RAID configuration was configured via the Hetzner rescue system rather than during setup with Hosting By Design, which was a neat change.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Swizzin install:</b> Same setup, just run 
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">bash &lt;(curl -sL s5n.sh) &amp;&amp; . ~/.bashrc</code></pre></figure>
then stare at the Advanced Options while touching none of them, wait a few mins, and done.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Application install:</b> A bit trickier this time. All installs were done through Swizzin's Box system, same as last time - Nginx, File Browser, Jellyfin, Panel, QBitTorrent, Plex, Vsftpd. However, a huge roadblock was <a href="https://linustechtips.com/topic/1531520-plex-blocks-ip-addresses-from-hetzner-as-of-october-12-2023/"> Hetzner server IP addresses being blocked by Plex</a>. I tried working around this, but couldn't find a usable solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore I had to find a new media server, and Jellyfin (my preferred client) was notoriously difficult working with IP addresses with self-signed SSL certificates. This is fine when connecting via PCs and other tech you actually control, much less so on a Smart TV. They simply don't let the user override the security warning. The main solution to this seems to be buying a cheap domain name annually, getting an independent SSL certificate issued for it, then connecting your media server to it. However, I'm a lazy cheapskate :3
    </p>
    <p>
        Enter Emby, the semi-closed-source client that Jellyfin forked away from. Same as Plex, the Quick Connect feature is what let me circumvent the SSL self-signed certificate issue. Functionally it's 95% similar to Jellyfin, but I'm not as smug when using it. However, a huge advantage is that it can be located easily on Smart TV's app stores, making it much more straightforward to install versus Jellyfin, which required root/dev access.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Porting old server files</b>: Still ongoing. Most files are permanently seeded on QBitTorrent, so I just mass copied the Magnet IDs of the torrents to re-download them on the new server. Which has the additional bonus of letting the other seeds in the network share the network load :3
    </p>
    <p>
        For any files I wasn't torrenting, running 
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">scp -r /directory_to_copy root@XXX.XXX.XXX.XX:/directory_to_copy_to </code></pre></figure>
 is sufficient. Probably. Still ongoing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once fully ported, I plan to run some speed comparisons, test the performance gain of the RAID 10 configuration, then drop the slower server.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>20th Feb Update:</b> I have decided that Hetzner actually sucks
