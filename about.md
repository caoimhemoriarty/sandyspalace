Internationally known and locally respected, it's the Revolver Ocelot of gender themselves.

This site has been an on and off plan for far too long, and I'm keeping it casual to make sure I keep having fun with it.

This site was built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, maintained with HTML, CSS, and precisely two lines of Javascript. Hosted via <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">GitHub Pages</a>. The font used is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand">Quicksand</a>.
